Level: Core
Credits: 04 credits
Pre-requisite: No
Reading/Writing: Intensive
Format: On-campus
Course Description: This course examines key moments in the global history of thought through the lens of textual analysis.  Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills.  
Summary
In order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at “change,” both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations.  This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism.  We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution?  And we ask how have our ideas about “change” changed over time?
Learning Objectives:
- Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.
- Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.
- Students will be able to critique each other’s perspectives in the context of group discussions.
- Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.",1:15 PM - 2:45 PM,1,0,1,0,0

Level: Advanced
Credits: 04 credits
Pre-requisite: No
Format: Online
Cross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Economics (ECON)
Course Description: This course provides students a rigorous introduction to key ideas, concepts, theories, and problems in classical and contemporary political economy and demonstrates their value for exploring, understanding, and explaining economies and economic aspects of social life in a variety of settings. Drawing on a sociological approach, the course emphasizes political economy’s social foundations and seeks to equip students with the ideas and skills needed to develop an informed analysis of some the most important social, political, economic, and cultural debates of our times. Rather than endorsing any one perspective on economy and society, the course surveys and combines multiple perspectives, drawing from ideas and concepts from various intellectual traditions spanning the fields of economics, sociology, politics, and anthropology. The course explores the strengths and weaknesses of these various traditions. In doing so, the course invites students to appreciate that, whatever our preferred explanatory frame or favored theory may be, no single perspective or intellectual standpoint is likely to be wholly sufficient for understanding or explaining actually existing economies.  Rather than dwelling on abstractions, the course addresses real world problems and themes.
Learning Objectives: 
•	Explain key concepts and theoretical approaches in classical, contemporary political economy.
•	Develop comparative perspectives on course themes addressed in a variety of settings.
•	Collect and use data to make or explore claims about variety of political economy themes.

Pre-requisite: This course is taught at an advanced level, and while there are no pre-requisites, the work expectations are designed for students with some experience writing, reading, and working in the social sciences.
Format: Online
Course Description: Asian women are underrepresented in politics and governance despite notable gains exemplified by the rise of prominent women leaders. A prevailing perception regards Asian women – especially those highly educated or from powerful families – as socio-politically as well or even better than their male counterparts. Yet there is little understanding of the history, nature, and challenge of Asian women’s struggle to exercise their political agency. This course offers students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of women and politics in Asia and to explore the significance of gender in politics of the past, present, and future. The course also examines various factors, trajectories and outcomes of women’s political advancement in contemporary Asia. This course aims to familiarize students with a broad range of issues involving women and politics in Asia – the political participation of women; the history of women’s movements; political divisions among women; and what we mean when we refer to “women’s issues” at home, at work, and in political institutions. Because women’s involvement in the political arena is informed by their roles and status at home and in society at large, the course will also examine sociological, anthropological, and feminist research on such topics as inequality, power, discrimination, and social norms. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning women in Vietnam and Asia.
Learning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to: 
•	Comprehend various institutional, cultural and personal factors, as well as distinctive trajectories and outcomes of women’s political engagement in Vietnam and Asia;
•	Use basic concepts and theories of women and politics;
•	Read critically the literature and other materials;
•	Write and present academic research reports; and,
•	Reflect upon women in politics and society of Vietnam and Asia.",6:30 PM - 8:00 PM,0,1,0,1,0

Level: Foundation
Credits: 04 credits
Pre-requisite: No
Format: Online
Course Description: This course explores traditions of inquiry, understanding, and explanation in the social sciences from age of classical social theory to the present. It begins by examining what means to represent (literally, re-present) or “tell about” social life, the various ways this has been and can be done, and the challenges we face in doing so in a way that brings value to the social settings and relations within which we work and live. It does so first by examining and comparing various genres of social representation and then distinguishing the social sciences as a distinctive if internally diverse set of approaches to understanding aspects of ""society"" or social life. To do this, the course offers a comparative introduction to traditions of social inquiry spanning the fields of sociology, political economy, economics, ""political science,"" and anthropology. Finally, the course considers the value and limitations of single-discipline only approaches to understanding the social world and the promise and challenges of a more transdisciplinary approach.

Format: On-campus
Course Description: In the aftermath of the Second World War, European civilization lay in ruins. Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at “trials” real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and “show” trials, trials of terrorists and “counter-terrorists,” as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe’s changing political landscape. 
“Europe on Trial” is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans—the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe’s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent.  
Learning Objectives: 
1.Understand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.
2.Compare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.
3.Analyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation. 
4.Evaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.
5.Craft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.",1:15 PM - 2:45 PM,0,1,0,1,0

Course Description: This course examines key moments in the global history of thought through the lens of textual analysis.  Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills.  
Summary
In order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at “change,” both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations.  This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism.  We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution?  And we ask how have our ideas about “change” changed over time?
Learning Objectives:
- Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.
- Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.
- Students will be able to critique each other’s perspectives in the context of group discussions.
- Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.",9:45 AM - 11:15 AM,0,1,0,1,0

Course Description: Digital technology transforms the way we live: from how we travel, to what we use for money, to how we swipe to find love. At the heart of these social, cultural, and economic changes lie mathematics and computer science. But how do we gather the information, interpret the data, and construct the algorithms that drive these advances and affect our lives? Quantitative Reasoning in a Digital Age not only develops foundational skills in mathematics and computer science, but demonstrates how computer programming and algorithmic thinking inform issues in fields as diverse as economics, psychology, history, and philosophy. Structured around project-based teamwork, students will examine how the toolkit of computational thinking can model human behavior and address real-world problems in business, education, public health, government, and other sectors. By understanding how quantitative reasoning affects modern society and modern society often affects our quantitative reasoning, students will learn to question their own assumptions about data big and small and think critically about the abundance of quantitative information that defines the decisions we make.
Learning Objectives: Students will be able to:
- Formulate research questions and collect appropriate data to address these questions
- Critically examine and identify patterns in quantitative data
- Investigate mathematical models computationally

Course Description: We learn across the Fulbright Core how transformations have happened in human history – transformations in thought, in social structures, and in individual lives. We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright’s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.
Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer’s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product’s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.
Learning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to
- Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.
- Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.
- Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.
- Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.
- Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.",3:00PM - 4:30PM,0,1,0,1,0

Course Description: In this era, we frequently turn to a computer for a variety of tasks, from simply converting inches to centimeters to producing sophisticated music and movies. How about having a computer done chemistry? In fact, computers and data science have been applied to solve a range of problems in science, especially since the booming of quantum theories in 1930s. The course will progressively build from foundational questions and theories of atoms, molecules, and materials to the use of computing power in addressing quantum problems and big data related issues. That includes, but not limited to, designing an innovative drug, calculating and predicting molecular properties, visualizing a chemical reaction in atomic levels, or solving a set of differential equations to understand electron spinning in atoms and molecules. Using project- and inquiry-based approaches, fundamental laws, concepts and calculations in physics and chemistry will be introduced, such as Molecular Orbital Theory, Hartree Fock Theory, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Descriptors and Machine Learning in chemistry. Students will also participate in collaborative research projects that potentially leads to scientific publications.

Course Description: Is climate change real? If so, to what extent? What are the factors causing it? And what are we willing to give up to stop it? This introductory course offers students a first touch in economics as an economist, not a student. Rather than consider hypothetical situations related to climate change, we will actually compute the empirical realities. In this course we will put economics in the context of how it analyzes and addresses real-world issues such as inequality, discrimination, and sustainability through the interplay of data and theory. While this course will be challenging, no prior knowledge of economics, statistics, or computer programming is assumed. 
Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
•	Explain Economics notions such as capitalism, fairness, and rationality
•	Conduct empirical research using Excel and/or R
•	Analyze labour and goods markets using appropriate economic models
•	Evaluate different public policy approaches to correcting incomplete markets

Course Description: Today, we live in a world characterized by connectivity unprecedented in human history. One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of “going there” has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human. As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.). As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.
Learning Objectives: By the end of this class, students will be able to:
•	Design and produce an ethnographic text through writing a mini-ethnography which includes a literature review section
•	Apply qualitative anthropological methods to analyze communication and community over new media.
•	Understand core concepts in digital anthropology 
•	Select, read, and synthesize secondary sources based on research interests
•	Reflect upon their own online experiences and identity formation.",3:00PM - 4:30PM,1,0,1,0,0

Course Description: This course covers East Asian History from 1600 to the present with a focus is on the tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, when China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam underwent rapid social and political transformations in response to unprecedented internal and external pressures. Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical ‘moments’, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion. The course is structured in four major units as follows:
Unit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839 
Unit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895) 
Unit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945) 
Unit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present) 
Learning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:
Knowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.
Skills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.
Mindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region's history. By extension, we will step outside of our usual ways of thinking about ethics, politics, and religion and develop a new appreciation for their historical contingency.",9:45 AM - 11:15 AM,0,0,1,0,1

Course Description: Images function as both a practical artistic medium (in advertisements for example) but also as something to be aesthetically enjoyed. They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. Students will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form.
Learning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- analyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens
- formulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts
- compose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts. ",8:00AM - 9:30AM,0,1,0,1,0

What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be 'the Asian century', the term ‘Post-Asia’ thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the ‘East vs West’ binary. This introductory course is required for all Art and Media Studies majors. (If you have taken Visual Culture previously, you have already completed this requirement.)",1:15 PM - 2:45 PM,0,1,0,1,0

Format: Online
Course Description: The Covid-19 pandemic is the greatest global health crisis faced by humankind in more than a century. It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world? How can global institutions be strengthened to promote international cooperation and effective health policies to prevent future pandemics? 
 Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, you will be able to
1.Define the social, economic and political challenges faced by the global community during the Covid-19 pandemic
2.Explain how international institutions responded to the Covid-19 pandemic
3.Identify the social, economic and political lessons learned by the global community from the Covid-19 pandemic
4.Propose global policies to address the health and welfare problems posed by future pandemics

Course Description: Venture capital investing is all the rage in Vietnam right now. A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few.
At the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world's leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.
This course is aimed at students seeking to understand the 'nuts and bolts' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.
Learning Objectives: At the end of this course, students should be able to:  
•	Understand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit 
•	Apply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors' as well as the entrepreneurs' point of view 
•	Articulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums 
•	Explain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly",5:00PM - 8:00PM,1,0,0,0,0

Course Description: Careful observation and reasoning have enabled social scientists to formulate principles of universal applicability to economic activities and outcomes. However, the economy is also embedded in a great variety of human cultures and circumstances. Religious values powerfully shape economic choices; habits and customs guide economic decision-making; circumstances and status constrain action and outcomes. Observable variety in economic forms and fortunes in the modern world reflect diversity in the values that people have brought to their economic endeavours, as well as in the capacities and strategies that they as economic actors have used to realise their desires. In other words, the economy is entwined in life, culture, and society, and must be studied in such contexts. This course introduces classic social science theories that explore the relationship between culture and the economy. Focussing on the market economy in modern Asia, it examines the cultural dispositions that have encouraged, retarded, and reshaped the development of capitalist market relations in this region. With case studies drawn from a range of countries and cultural milieux, it examines how the transition to the market has been enabled and experienced. As a user's guide to the market economy in Asia it uncovers the variety of ways that local actors have maintained, adapted and instrumentalised culture to make a living. It examines economic complexity: how local values shape the economy; how people limit the impact of the market in their lives; and how they conceptualise, cope with and challenge marketisation. It offers a guide to the lived economy in Asia, in all its splendid variety and ingenuity.
Learning Objectives: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:
•	Explain the main theories and concepts used in class.
•	Understand and describe the connections between culture and the economy.
•	Apply the theories and concepts learned in class to critically assess the relationship between culture and the economy in Asia.
•	Use the comparative method to contextualise and explain regional variations in economic practice and outcomes. 
•	Critically analyze and evaluate published research.
•	Apply the theories and concepts learned to analyze the nexus between culture and the economy in Vietnam. 
•	Develop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.
•	Communicate course concepts clearly, coherently, and with adequate use of evidence in spoken and written forms.",9:45 AM - 11:15 AM,0,1,0,1,0

Course Description: We learn across the Fulbright Core how transformations have happened in human history – transformations in thought, in social structures, and in individual lives. We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright’s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.
Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer’s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product’s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.
Learning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to
- Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.
- Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.
- Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.
- Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.
- Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.",9:45 AM - 11:15 AM,1,0,1,0,0

Format: On-campus
Course Description: Digital technology transforms the way we live: from how we travel, to what we use for money, to how we swipe to find love. At the heart of these social, cultural, and economic changes lie mathematics and computer science. But how do we gather the information, interpret the data, and construct the algorithms that drive these advances and affect our lives? Quantitative Reasoning in a Digital Age not only develops foundational skills in mathematics and computer science, but demonstrates how computer programming and algorithmic thinking inform issues in fields as diverse as economics, psychology, history, and philosophy. Structured around project-based teamwork, students will examine how the toolkit of computational thinking can model human behavior and address real-world problems in business, education, public health, government, and other sectors. By understanding how quantitative reasoning affects modern society and modern society often affects our quantitative reasoning, students will learn to question their own assumptions about data big and small and think critically about the abundance of quantitative information that defines the decisions we make.
Learning Objectives: Students will be able to:
- Formulate research questions and collect appropriate data to address these questions
- Critically examine and identify patterns in quantitative data
- Investigate mathematical models computationally
- Effectively work in teams",1:15 PM - 2:45 PM,0,1,0,0,1
