    "description": "Faculty: Linda Zhang - E: linda.zhang@fulbright.edu.vn\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\nPre-requisite: CORE 101 Global Humanities and Social Change\n* This course serves as a pre-requisite for most intermediate and advanced Art and Media Studies courses.\n---\nCourse Description:\nImages function as both a practical artistic medium (in advertisements for example) but also as something to be aesthetically enjoyed. They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\n---\nSample Topic Schedule\n\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\n1.

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nAt the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n1.

A key area of investigation will be how the concepts of modernity and modernism have been expressed by artists in reaction to major technological and geopolitical developments in the twentieth century. We will situate artworks within their local contexts while remaining attentive to the transnational nature of certain movements. This postcolonial approach decenters the Eurocentric narrative of modern art and emphasizes how modernism emerged from sites of exchange and encounter between artistic communities in Asia, Europe, Africa, the United States, and Latin America. While students will gain familiarity with movements or themes such as realism, cubism, primitivism, surrealism, the Bauhaus, abstraction, and pop, a comparative approach to these practices in a global context (e.g., surrealist art in Paris and Cairo, abstraction in New York and Osaka) will help us better understand how modernism forged new directions in the nature of artistic representation, and more particularly, the artist\u2019s sense of their role in society and the larger world.\n\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nDefine modernity and modernism in the context of art history.\nIdentify important modern art movements and artists across a global comparative context.\nDemonstrate competency in visual analysis, textual interpretation, and the use of art historical terminology.\nAnalyze the connections between the formal attributes of artworks and their relevant historical, political, and cultural contexts.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nNot including days for revision/exams\n1.

It aims to deepen students\u2019 understanding of photography\u2014its historical development, aesthetic considerations, and pictorial strategies\u2014through hands-on engagement with styles and concepts. The course provides an opportunity for students to expand their technical and creative range through weekly assignments and critique sessions. Students will learn the basics of digital cameras, image-editing software, and key photographic techniques. Students will examine photographic works from internationally celebrated photographers to arrive at their own understanding of how photographic images are created, reproduced, and valued within both fine art photography and photography-as-art traditions. As such, they will learn to develop conceptual ideas, offer constructive critique to their peers, and locate their work in the broader context of contemporary photographic practice. Topics for discussion include visual ambiguity, objectivity, staging, authenticity, the digital and the analogue, and AI influence on photography, among others.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to use their own DSLR cameras.\n\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nAfter this course, students should be able to\n1. Cultivate an enhanced appreciation of photography as an artistic practice, to be considered across different cultural and social contexts.\n2.

We are living in a time after the pandemic where movie theater seems to be becoming obsolete, especially due to shifts in viewing and industry practices towards streaming distribution. In turn, we should question how shifts in viewing and screening practices change how we define the cinematic experience. The course offers a new way to think about the changing spectatorship practices while also introducing Chinese-language cinema from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong since the late 1980s. Through research and writing assignments, we will focus on questions of not only where these films were produced and directed, but also how and where they were screened around the world. We will investigate past, current, and evolving viewing practices, not just in terms of circulation and screening, but also in terms of how the movie theater and theater-going are represented and commemorated within these films. Introducing major theoretical and historical scholarship on contemporary Chinese language cinema, we will consider how memories, screens, and theaters concretize the pleasure of viewing and imagining through film and media.\n\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nCLO1. Students will be able to demonstrate familiarity with filmwork and filmmakers from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\nCLO2.

    "description": "Faculty: Richard Streitmatter-Tran - E: Richard.tran@fulbright.edu.vn\nPre-requisite: ARTS 101 Introduction to Visual Studies AND ARTS 107 2D/3D Foundations\n---\nCourse Description:\nThis course will expand upon art fundamentals through the development of an oil painting practice for both traditional and contemporary painting methods including direct (alla prima) and indirect painting (imprimatur, grisaille, chiaroscuro, glazing) and limited palettes. Topics covered will include painting tools and paint, preparation processes for painting canvas supports, sizes and grounds, medium, varnishes, pigments, solvents, painting procedures, and the care of finished paintings. Students will learn the history of oil painting and be introduced to a selection of artists for insight on painting concepts, styles and techniques. Exercises and assessments will focus on developing a structured painting process. Class discussions and critiques will assist the student in developing and defending their painting concepts. There is a list of personal supplies that students must purchase for the course. It is estimated that the total cost will be around 1,000,000 VND.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nCLO1. Demonstrate advanced skill in a variety of painting methods\nCLO2. Identify art-historical references, artists, styles, methods and techniques\nCLO3. Analyze, evaluate and discuss artwork in formal art critique\nCLO4. Communicate ideas through making and articulate their process while developing their unique individual style\nCLO5. Write an artist statement\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nSection 1: Introduction to the Course\nThe course overview and assessments, readings, required materials, art studio and safety protocols. Students will learn about the history of oil paint. Instructor will accompany students to the art store to assist them in purchasing their personal supplies for the next class.\n\nSection 2: Introduction to Oil Painting\nStudents will be introduced to oil paint, mediums, and solvents. A review of color theory (with specific application to oil paint). \nExercise: Color mixing with oils. Students will create a color chart using the Munsell method (value, hue, chroma) and a skin-tone reference chart.\n\nSection 3: Preparing the Support\nStudents will learn how to stretch canvas and prepare the support for painting with layers of gesso. Students will prepare the large 80 x 60 support that will be used later in the semester for their final project.\nHomework: Students will research and identify three painters working in oil whose style they want to emulate or are inspired by. The styles of these painters will be referenced by students in the successive class exercises and assessments, as students strive to learn from them.\n\nSection 4: Introduction to Alla Prima\nStudents will be introduced to the Alla Prima (All at Once) direct method of painting, where the painting is completed within one to three days, allowing the students to work wet-on-wet, including impasto painting. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working with this method. Students will be introduced to artists and artworks related to Alla Prima painting, notably in portraiture and in plein-air painting. \nExercise: Students begin the Alla Prima painting assessment, due next class.\n\nSection 5: Limited Palette \nStudents will be introduced to a limited palette (e.g. The Zorn Palette). Students will study works that utilize a limited palette including Anders Zorn, Caravaggio, John Singer Sargent and Alpay Efe. \nExercise: Students will be map out the Zorn Palette as preparation for the Assessment 2: The Limited Palette Painting. \n\n+++ASSESSMENT 1: Alla Prima Painting Due++++\n\nSection 6: Introduction to Plein Air Painting\nStudents will be introduced to Plein Air (outdoor) painting, another direct painting method using paint directly from the tube to create a painting in the impressionistic style. \nExercise: Choosing an appropriate site for plein air painting, students will work on site to complete a small plein air painting by the end of class.\n\nSection 7: Introduction to Indirect Painting\nStudents will be introduced to the Indirect Painting method where the painting is constructed in layers of paint. Beginning with the sketch, imprimatur, grisaille (tonal underpainting) toward latter applications of paint in layers (fat over lean principle, glazing). This section will begin the series of painting phases culminating in a completed painting and Final Project Assessment.\nExercise: Students will work on research material and draw sketches for their final project and prepare sketches for transfer on prepared toned canvas.\n\n+++ASSESSMENT 2: Limited Palette Painting Due ++++\n\nSection 8: Painting the Grisaille\nStudents will learn the process of creating the tonal grisaille painting. Students will complete the grisaille of painting for the next application of color in the next class.\n\nSection 9: First Application of Color\nUtilizing the fat-over-lean principle in oil painting, students will add the first lean layer of paint over the underpainting. Introduction to glazing, the addition of color using semi-transparent oil paints. *Note that direct painting requires a layer to be completely dry before painting upon. A week will be necessary for thinner layers to be ready for new layers of paint. Oil drying mediums may be used (such as Liquitex) to quicken drying times.\n\nSection 10: Successive Applications of Paint\nStudents will continue toward the completion of their paintings adding new layers of color upon the dried underlayer. Focus on edge and brushstroke variation.\n\nSection 11: Finishing the Indirect Painting \nStudents will work to finish their paintings with final layers and details.\n\nSection 12: Final Project Critique Part 1 (50% of class)\nStudents will present their final projects work in progress in class critiques. Students will learn about the value of constructive criticism, both in giving and receiving. \n\n+++ASSESSMENT 3: Final Project Paintings are due +++\n\nSection 13: Final Project Critique Part 2 (50% of class)\nStudents will present their final projects work in progress in class critiques. Students will learn about the value of constructive criticism, both in giving and receiving. \n\nSection 14: Final Course Review\nWe will reflect on the studio practice of oil painting and discuss ways to continue experimentation with the medium for future works.\nReadings from:\nGregg Kreutz.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to\n1. Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\n2. Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\n3. Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\n4. Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\n5. Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design?

In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to\n1.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes: \nAfter the course, students will be able to\nDemonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\nStrengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, analyze and simulation of systems process input signals in order to produce the desired outputs or to control the systems\u2019 behaviors.\nDeepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills.\nWork effectively as a team to complete group assignments on practical signal processing applications.\nCommunicate clearly their results via professional report writing and presentation.\n---\nTextbook: James McClellan, Ronald Schaffer, and Mark Yoder, \u201cDSP First\u201d, 2nd Edition, Pearson, 2017 (Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/DSP-First-2nd-James-McClellan/dp/0136019250).\nThis textbook has a companion website for additional resources: https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/.\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nAttendance and Quizzes: 15%\nHomework sets: 20%\nMidterm Exam: 15%\nMini-projects: 20%\nFinal Exam: 30%",

A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\nIdentify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\nExplain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\nExplain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\nExplain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\nPropose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\nCritically analyze and interpret primary sources\nClearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\n---\nTentative Class Schedule\nWeek 1:\nStart Unit 1: The Cold War \nDiscuss Rubric and Assignment Guide for Assignment 1 \nKnow-What-Learn (KWL) to assess your knowledge of the Cold War and identify learning goals for this unit. \nYou will individually fill out the first two columns of a KWL chart\u2014what do you know about the Cold War?

The wars in Vietnam evolved from an anti-colonial struggle into a superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As conflict in Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states and non-state actors.\nThis course will examine critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers become so deeply involved in Vietnamese affairs? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? And what are the global legacies of the war?\nIn addition to examining its origins and evolution, the course will use the conflict to explore broader international events and trends, including empire and decolonization, the Chinese Civil War, the Sino-Soviet Split, D\u00e9tente, and the Cambodian Genocide.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nIdentify and contextualize the main events and key figures in the history of the Vietnam conflict\nExplain the origins, evolution, and consequences of the Vietnam conflict\nAssess the scholarship on the conflict and demonstrate an understanding of the historical debates about its causes and effects\nDemonstrate the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing\nCritically analyze a range of primary and secondary sources\nEvaluate the interplay between domestic politics and foreign affairs in a wide range of global contexts\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nWeek 1:\nCourse Introduction\nThe Origins and Character of France\u2019s Indochina Empire\nReading: Aviel Roshwald, \u201cColonial Dreams of the French Right Wing, 1881-1914,\u201d The Historian (1994); plus some primary sources. \n\nWeek 2:\nVietnamese Anti-colonialism\nReading: Christopher E.

    "description": "Faculty: Andrew Harold Bellisari\u2013 E: andrew.bellisari@fulbright.edu.vn\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: Completion of at least one foundation course in History. Students will be expected to have a general knowledge of modern European history.\nReading/Writing: Intensive\n---\nCourse Description: \nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, European civilization lay in ruins. Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past.

Topics covered include Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry (and anti-Masonic conspiracy theories), Sebastianism, the mass hysteria at Loudun, Protestant and Catholic witchcraft panic, Waldensianism, early modern appropriations of Joachim of Fiore (including by Christopher Columbus), Catholic and Protestant conspiracy theories about the other, anti-Jesuit sentiment, the Man in the Iron Mask, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (an antisemitic modification of earlier conspiracies unrelated to Judaism), the Orange Order, the KKK, and finally anti-Masonic and anti-Jesuit conspiracism in the Spanish Civil War and the Violencia in Colombia. Student research can cover any cult, occult organization or conspiratorial belief since 1450. With any luck we will also touch on a few Asian appropriations of the European occult and conspiracy beliefs touched on earlier, such as the Taiping Rebellion and the Cao Dai religion.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nStudents will explore scholarly definitions of \u201ccults\u201d (vs religions) and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d (vs documented closed-door agendas, for example the Wannsee conference) and arrive at a working definition of each which assists them in understanding remaining course readings and provides the intellectual and methodological infrastructure for their own research.\nStudents will explore and adopt oral history methods in order to compare the internal understanding of members of nonmainstream religious groups about their organization\u2019s history versus external, scholarly, academic, journalistic and mainstream understandings of the same history.\nStudents will learn to analyze, verbally and in writing, ambiguously fringe, abusive, seditious or otherwise unstable groups with nuance, intellectual rigor and a certain amount of sympathy for members\u2019 self-understanding, including for groups which no longer exist but were important historically. \nStudents will explore the contentious historiography around many important nonstandard or new religious/occult/esoteric groups and their contribution to (or lack thereof) major historical events. They will come to understand how conspiracy theories around such groups often have more explanatory power than the groups themselves. \nStudents will learn about historical conspiracy theories around unequivocally noncult religious groups (e.g. Protestants, Muslims, Catholics/Jesuits, Jews) and/or ethnic minorities, the accompanying racialization and pathologization of practitioners/members, and associated violence. They will identify patterns of escalation and deescalation and explore questions of demarcation between religious groups and the racialization of religion beginning in the early modern era. \nStudents will think critically about which historical assumptions by conspiracists, cult members, witchfinders, and genuine conspirators continue to manifest themselves in the present day, as well as instances of successful \u201cdeprogramming\u201d or deescalation of violence in the context of their applicability to the present.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nWeek 1: Renaissance occultism, astrology, Hermeticism, Giordano Bruno, The \u201cCheese and the Worms\u201d\nExcerpts: Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition by Frances Yates\nExcerpts: The Cheese and the Worms by Carlo Ginzburg\nMaurizio Campanelli, \u201cMarsilio Ficino's portrait of Hermes Trismegistus and its afterlife\u201d\n\nWeek 2: The panic at Loudun, witchcraft panic in the Protestant and Catholic world, real Renaissance serial killers\nWilliam Smith, \u201cFriedrich F\u00f6rner, the Catholic Reformation, and Witch-Hunting in Bamberg\u201d\nIldiko Kristov, \u201c\u201cCharming Sorcerers\u201d or \u201cSoldiers of Satan\u201d?

The title of this course asks: what does it mean to be human? We will expand on that question by also asking: have technological advancements changed the definition of humanity? In what ways does the definition of humanity dependent upon other social factors such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, and nationality? And, how has literature been used as a technology for determining humanity? Through a discussion-based classroom, we will approach these questions by reading and comparing texts from multiple different literary genres, including fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and film. In this course, we will also learn to appreciate the aesthetic and functional quality of texts, focusing on style, intertextuality, and critical value. We will also explore different ways of approaching texts depending on their genre and form, and practice important skills such as close reading, developing arguments, and expressing ideas clearly orally and in writing. Finally, the course will also prompt students to question the value of literature in contemporary society, and how to make connections beyond the material with the world around them. \n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nDeveloping an argument and organized structure in a written essay\nMaking appropriate use of primary and secondary sources as supporting evidence for claims in an essay\nUtilizing preparatory writing strategies such as drafting, revising, and peer review to conceptualize ideas\nIdentifying and analyzing the literary qualities of at least two forms or genres\nConnecting the material beyond the text to other disciplines and contexts\nObtain a working knowledge of the connection between literature/writing/language and technology, especially in regards to how literature has historically been used as a technology for determining humanity alongside other vectors of power such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, etc.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nThis course would be divided thematically into three units.

We will ask: what is epic literature? How do texts construct literary heroes, and why are they important? What role do national heroes and epic figures play in our perception of our own culture, our community, and the outside world? Over the course of the semester, we will discover how foundational texts of epic literature from the often-misunderstood Middle Ages and early modern era ultimately underpin modern epic fantasies like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, or Avatar. Topics may include the power of myth, epic propaganda, the warrior hero, the monstrous other, visions of masculinity throughout time, and the role of women in the hero\u2019s journey. Moreover, this class will look at medieval and early modern epics from a wide variety of cultures, both Western and non-Western, in order to challenge the idea of the universal hero; instead, we will examine how heroic and epic narratives were deeply intertwined with the values and beliefs of the cultures that produced them.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\nStrengthen reading and analytical skills\nObtain a working knowledge of the epic tradition and compare Western conventions of epic with the epic in other venues (the Middle East, the Far East, etc.)\nUnderstand how literary conventions build over time and deepen our understanding of influence (both horizontal and vertical\u2014intercultural and temporal)\nMake connections between literary works and the society or time period that produced them\nStrengthen argumentative ability, both orally and in writing\nExpand their understanding of a major literary time period (the medieval) and familiarize themselves with some of its major canonical works\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nReading schedule\nUnit 1: Foundations of Epic Literature\nWeek 1: Course introduction\nDay 1: Course introduction, classroom contract activity, syllabus review\nDay 2: \u201cThe Hero Monomyth\u201d (Campbell) & Lord Raglan\u2019s characteristics\nWeek 2: Establishing the genre of epic literature\nDay 1: Epic of Gilgamesh I (Babylonian)\nDay 2: Epic of Gilgamesh II (Babylonian)\nWeek 3: Establishing the genre of epic literature\n- Day 1: The Odyssey (excerpts: his pride, Cyclops, Calypso, and Circe episodes) (Greek)\n- Day 2: The Odyssey (excerpts: Scylla and Charybdis, Penelope, and Odysseus\u2019 return) (Greek)\n\nUnit 2: The national medieval epic (8th-12th centuries)\nWeek 4: Anglo-Saxon England \nDay 1: History Day: Anglo-Saxon culture (5-10th c.) \nDay 2: Anglo-Saxon culture: \u201cThe Battle of Maldon\u201d & \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d (Old English)\nWeek 5: Anglo-Saxon England  \nDay 1: Beowulf I (Grendel episode) (Old English)\nDay 2: Beowulf II (Grendel\u2019s mother episode) (Old English)\nWeek 6: Anglo-Saxon England/Transition week\nDay 1: Beowulf III (Dragon episode) (Old English) \nDay 2: History and material culture day: The medieval Persian Empire \nPaper 1 due @ the end of this week\nWeek 7: Persian national epic\nDay 1: Shahnameh I (Birth and exile of Zal) (Persian)\nDay 2: Shahnameh II (Return of Zal and Rudaba episode) (Persian)\nWeek 8: Persian national epic\nDay 1: Shahnameh III (Birth of Rostam and his exploits) (Persian)\nDay 2: Shahnameh IV (Rostam and Shaghad\u2019s betrayal) (Persian)\nWeek 9: Midterm break\nWeek 10: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\nDay 1: History day\u2014 the Chivalric Era (12-15th c.) and the Reconquista\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar I (Spanish)\nWeek 11: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\nDay 1: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar II (Spanish)\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar III (Spanish)\nPaper 2 due @ the end of this week\nWeek 12: Medieval France\nDay 1: Chanson de Roland I (French)\nDay 2: Chanson de Roland II (French)\nUnit 3: Early modern iterations \u2013 the epic in a changing world (1605-1820)\nWeek 13: Mock epic and the changing world\nDay 1: Don Quixote I (chapters 1-7) (Spanish)\nDay 2: Don Quixote II (chapters 8-15) (Spanish)\nWeek 14: Early modern Vietnam\nDay 1: The Tale of Kieu I (Vietnamese)\nDay 2: The Tale of Kieu II (Vietnamese)\nWeek 15: Course wrap-up\nDay 1: Modern epics (by student selection) \nDay 2: Modern epics (by student selection)\nFinal project due by the end of this week\n ---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\n20% Participation & Attendance\n14% Reading quizzes (7 x 2% each)\n20% Paper 1 (Close analysis/change over text paper)\n20% Paper 2 (Historical Context/Values paper)\n26% Final Wiki Project (6% proposal, 20% final)",

Yet, in the contemporary moment, people across the world are increasingly (re)turning to poetry as mode of grappling with the inconceivable contradictions of modern life: pandemics, authoritarian regimes, climate change, births and deaths, quotidian celebrations, stubborn joy. \u201cI don\u2019t think poems will save us\u2014us, as in, this country, this world,\u201d writes Marlin M. Jenkins, \u201cBut poems continue to save me.\u201d \nWhat, then, does a poem do? This course introduces students to contemporary poetry by exploring the multifaceted answers to this guiding question. Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey, we will focus our reading to trace poetic actions or what specific poems \u201cdo.\u201d In addition to poems, we will also read a selection of prose essays written by poets about poetry. Through our reading, we will situate each poem and its poetic action within the broader sociopolitical and historical context in which it was written. We will also learn to identify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, lyricism, and movement. Readings will mainly consist of poets writing in English post-1975 such as Victoria Chang, Mai Der Vang, Claudia Rankine, Warsan Shire, Philip Metres, and others.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\nIdentify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, and lyricism.\nObtain a working knowledge of key genre differences between poetry and other literary forms (and also important overlaps).\nMake connections between diverse poetic elements and the sociopolitical context of the poem\u2019s creation.\nImprove their reading and analytical skills for diverse forms of poetry.\nImprove their written and oral communication skills.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nRequired Texts:\nMany of the primary texts for this class will be sourced from the contemporary archives of online literary journals.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language.

Case studies are among the essential, oldest, and fundamental research methodologies within the spectrum of qualitative research methods in social sciences. In the disciplines of political science, international relations, gender studies, communication, and media studies, among others, case studies are essential methodological tools for conducting research. As Baxter and Jack (2008) note, \u201cQualitative case study are a valuable method for [\u2026] research to develop theory, evaluate programs, and develop interventions\u201d (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p.544). Case studies allow researchers and students to understand complex to generate theories, test theories, and explore new research directions, illustrating their importance as qualitative research methods (Bhattacherje, 2008). \nThis course will introduce students to the methodology of case study research and what a case study is. Throughout the course, students will learn about the theoretical framework of case studies, their structure, their importance, and the type of case studies in existence and widely used in social sciences. Furthermore, it discusses and highlights the (ongoing) debate in social sciences on case studies. Subsequently, students will learn how to develop their own case study research design and execute their case study research. \nThe sum of this allows students to gain: An in-depth understanding of the importance and utility of case studies as essential research methods in social sciences, as well introduce them to developing research designs, with a particular focus on case study research design and finally gain experience in conducting case study research.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nCLO1: Students will learn about qualitative research methods \u2013 in particular case study research.\nCLO2: Students will understand the importance of case study research, as a research method, and for social sciences.\nCLO3: Students will learn how to conduct case study research methods (and apply these to the social sciences).\nCLO4: Students gain practical experience conducting case study research\nCLO5: Students gain practical experience in conducting research as a team.\nCLO6: Develop the ability to evaluate and critique existing case study studies and identify strengths and weaknesses.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nBlock 1 Theoretical Foundations\nWeek 1 Intro\nWeek 2 Social Science Research and qualitative research methods.\nWeek 3 What is the case study research?\nWeek 4 Case study research in social sciences.\nWeek 5 Case study research.

Start your own case study research. \nWeek 13 Peer assessment.\nWeek 14 End of the term recap. \n--- \nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nBlock 1 Assessment. Discuss a well or poorly conducted case study (20%). For the first assessment of the course, students are expected to write a 500-word essay focusing on a chosen case study. In this assignment, they will summarize the case study, explain why they chose it, and argue why it was a well-conducted or poorly conducted case study. \nMidterm assessment: Design your case study research design (30%). The midterm aims to have students apply the theoretical foundations they learned and subsequently develop their own case study research design. This assessment will be conducted in groups of 4 to 6 students. The assessment length would be around 2000 words per group submission.\nFinal term assessment: Execute your case study research (40%). For the final term assignment, students will conduct their case study research, again in a group of 4 to 6 students. Ideally, this is based on their midterm research design, but they can propose an entirely new project if desired. This assessment aims to have students learn how to conduct their own case study research. Students will use the final block \u201cpractice\u201d to execute their research design. In-class hours will be used to discuss research designs and execution, guide students, and for peer assessment. The expected length of their case study is about 3000 words per group submission. \nAttendance (10%). Students are expected to participate in all classes, with a maximum of 3 classes absent. Furthermore, in class discussion is expected.  ",

As stated by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, \u201cWe are not concerned to know what goodness is but how to become good [people]\u2026, since otherwise our inquiry would be useless.\u201d This course introduces students to key texts and concepts in the study of ethics and moral philosophy. Students will connect theoretical approaches to the study of morality to one another, and to their own lives.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\n1. Demonstrate critical reading and thinking about dense philosophical texts through oral and written articulation of different philosophical ideas\n2. Demonstrate familiarity with classic texts and arguments related to ethics and moral philosophy through discussion and short- and long-form writing\n3. Demonstrate familiarity with the broader intellectual history and context of ethical and moral reasoning through discussion and short- and long-form writing\n4. Connect classical philosophical theories to contemporary local and global contexts through discussion and short- and long-form writing.\n---\nTentative Schedule:\nPart One - Classical Approaches: Epistemology We begin our class with an examination of philosophy in general.\nWe ask ourselves - what is philosophy for? What is wisdom? What does it do? How can we go from ignorance to knowledge?\nWeek One - Introductions, Apologies\nWeek Two - The Republic\n\nPart Two - Classical Approaches: Virtue Ethics in the East and West\nWe move to the first of the three most well known schools of moral philosophy - Virtue Ethics, which argues that virtuous action is necessary for the good life. We juxtapose the thoughts of two highly influential philosophers who lived around the same time in very different places, Aristotle and Confucius.\nWeek Three - Happiness and Virtue\nWeek Four - Friendship and Love\nWeek Five - Confucian Virtue Ethics\nWeek Six - Virtuous Junzi - Confucius and Aristotle in Vietnam\n\nPart Three - Nature and Culture - Social Contract and Natural Law Theory\nIn this section, we will discuss the significance of such concepts as \u201cnatural law\u201d, \u201crights\u201d, \u201clegitimacy\u201d, and \u201cliberty\u201d in the formulation of moral philosophy from the enlightenment onwards. After introducing the concept of natural law developed by Aquinas to reconcile contradictions between christian and aristotelian moral worldviews, we look at how the idea of \u201cnature\u201d has shaped philosophical thinking from Hobbes onwards.\nWeek Seven - Natural Law, Laws of Nature\nWeek Eight - Social Contract\n\nPart Four: Consequentialism and Deontology\nWeek Nine - Eleven\n\nPart Five: The Problem of Evil\nWeek Twelve - Fifteen\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nParticipation: 20%\nWritten Reflection: 60%\nFinal exam: 20%",

Using examples drawn from various points in history, various countries around the world, and various disability categories (psychiatric/psychosocial, intellectual, physical, etc.), students read a variety of texts, including ethnographies, autobiographies, and case studies, in order to understand the variety of the disability experience. This class draws from critical disability studies, feminist, and queer theory. \n---\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\nExplain the difference between the medical model and social model of disability and how these two models work in practice\nDiscuss the social, legal, and personal effects of each model on how different cultures (including the U.S.) treat persons with disabilities\nIdentify and explicate key themes in the study of disability from a socio-cultural perspective\nCritically discuss bioethical debates around disability\nIdentify and discuss how disability is experienced differently from an intersectional (class, race, gender, sex, ethnicity, nationality) viewpoint\n---\nTentative Syllabus\nWeek 1.0 Introduction to the Course; Smashing Stereotypes; Disability Theory\nAdichie, Chimamanda Ngozi. 2009. \u201cThe Danger of a Single Story\u201d TED Talk. https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story\nHand out syllabus\nCourse requirements and expectations\nQ&A\nHayes, Michael T. and Rhonda S.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  Core concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nStudents Will Be Able To:\n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nClass Participation -- 20%\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\nArticle Review -- 10%\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%",

The SRV Constitution\u2019s goal of building \u201ca progressive culture deeply imbued with national identity\u201d has guided Vietnamese policy since 1992 and figures into national strategies for sustainable development for the coming decades. Similar challenges have faced many countries around the world as they undergo rapid industrialization and post-industrialization. Responding to those challenges, an array of international treaties has been developed to support national efforts and international cooperation.\nThis 300-level course provides an overview of the development and evolution of concepts of \u201ccultural heritage\u201d over the past century and around the world, examines the existing international legal framework, and analyzes Vietnamese responses (legal and regulatory as well as practical). The course approaches heritage from the perspectives of anthropology and critical heritage studies, combining intensive analyses of heritage policy with case studies of how such policies are applied on the ground. Special attention will be given to examining recent controversies in Vietnam over different aspects of cultural heritage. The focus will be on built cultural heritage (monuments and relics) and intangible cultural heritage.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nCLO1: Situate Vietnam\u2019s approach to cultural heritage within global trends and frameworks, highlighting the Vietnamization of those international concepts and approaches\nCLO2: Develop critical reading skills as applied to international treaties, Vietnamese domestic laws, and Vietnamese implementing regulations, emphasizing responsibilities of citizens and the state\nCLO3: Research and analyze current cases and controversies in Vietnam\u2019s application of international heritage treaties and domestic heritage laws, highlighting critical contributions of leading Vietnamese scholars\nCLO4: Understand how issues of heritage and identity pose fundamental challenges to Vietnamese citizens, especially young ones, as they seek to ensure a sustainable future\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nTemporary link for readings and documents: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLaO1gAtdRtlW4Kh90BNbe9Gyv11MnOY?usp=sharing [asterisks indicate works available both in English and in Vietnamese]\n\nWeek one: introduction and objectives of the course\nIntroduction of professor and students; review of syllabus and course requirements\nGleason, Philip. 1983.

    "description": "Faculty: Tobias Burgers - E: tobias.burgers@fulbright.edu.vn\nPre-requisite: This course fulfills the theory requirement for Social Studies. For third year or later.\nReading/Writing: Intensive\n---\nCourse Description:\nTechnology is omnipresent in our lives and has shaped, currently, and will shape much of modern society's functioning. Its impact, both positive and negative, has economic, ethical, political, and sociological consequences and alters every aspect of our society. This impact process has been, however one in which accountability has been difficult. Such brings up the question: Can we control technological development? Should we even? If so, by what means, by whom, how, under which conditions, and with which tools?  \nThe question of how to address these issues is at the heart of studies by scholars of governance. Governance refers to \"all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities.\" (Bevir, 2012). \nThis course provides an overview of how society seeks to control, steer, and manage technology and technological change. It will introduce students to critical actors and concepts of governance and technological governance and the role of various actors in this process. Students will learn to answer questions, such as identifying technological change, what role society has in this process, what political, legal, ethical, and social frameworks exist for such governance, and who decides the governance conditions. \nUsing case studies on the internet, AI technology, and climate change, students will apply the theoretical learnings of this course practically, enabling them to think, engage, and write critically about technology and technological governance. \n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nCLO 1 Students will learn about governance and technological governance, its function and importance in the social sciences.\nCLO 2 Students will scientifically research on governance, technological change and tech governance. \nCLO 3 Students will present their research output in written form and through presentations.\nCLO 4 Students will learn, understand and analyze how society react, and (seeks to) control technology and its impact. \nCLO 5 Students will be able to apply the course learnings into their own life and Vietnamese society, and understand societal needs and reactions to technology and technological change.\nCLO 6 Students will gain further broader learning about political sciences, sociology and science, technology and society studies.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nBlock 1: Introduction.\nWeek 01: Course Introduction.\nWeek 02: Understanding governance.\nWeek 03: Understanding technological governance.\n\nBlock 2: Actors of governance.\nWeek 04: The role of governments in technological governance.\nWeek 05: The role of commercial actors in technological governance.\nWeek 06: The role of society in technological governance.\n\nBlock 3 Influences of technological change and its impact on technological governance.\nWeek 07 Equality or inequality? Technological change and its social impact and how it affects technological governance. \nWeek 08 The ethics of technology and innovation and its impact on technological governance.\nWeek 09 Semester break \nWeek 10 The role of risk and risk perceptions in the shaping of technological governance.\n\nBlock 4: From theory to praxis.\nWeek 11: The internet and technological governace. A case study\nWeek 12: AI and technological governance. A case study,\nWeek 13: Climate change and technological governance. A case study.\nWeek 14: Course recap\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nStudents will be evaluated based on their participation in the course, as well assignments.\nThe participation grade is made up of attendance (5%) and in class participation (5%). This means actively engaging in discussion, asking questions and ensuring that you have active voice in the class. \nThe assignments consist of 1) block 1 and 2 reflection paper (20%, 500 words), 2) block 3 position paper, (30%, 1000 words) and 3) the final assignment (40%), for which the format can be chosen by the students. \nFor this the following options are available 1) An end-of-the-term paper (2500 words), 2) A 15 min presentation (20%) and short end-of-the-term paper 25(%) (1500 words) (Presentations can be made as group effort and are encouraged). 3) A video discussion about any of the topics in the seminar. The video should be about 30 min and should be made by a pair of students. The topic of the video discussion is open to discussion and should discussed in advance with me. The video submission should be a free-flowing discussion, which is clear, on-point, sharp and demonstrates an understanding of the topic of choice, and foremost, critically evaluates the chosen topic.",

The past three decades have seen Vietnam increasingly rising as a political as well as economic power in the Southeast Asian region. Given its growing economic size and political influence, Vietnam\u2019s regional footprint is progressively noticeable. This course helps students understand how politics, history, culture, and customs could have an impact on the rapidly changing economy and society in contemporary Vietnam. It will focus on the discussion how political, economic and social forces shape a \u201csocialism-oriented market economy\u201d as the Vietnamese government claims. Put simply, the primary focus is on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy. The course is organized into two broad primary portions: 1) The history of Vietnam and the Vietnam\u2019s economic renovation (Doi Moi) since 1986; and 2) Contemporary issues the country is facing. This first part will only capture the key periods and turning points in historical Vietnam, which is necessary for understanding how historical institutions continue to shape the nation\u2019s politics and economy today. The remainder of the course will be on the Vietnamese economic reform since 1986 and contemporary issues, with an emphasis on the relationship between politics and economic development, plus cross-country comparisons as well as key challenges facing the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership, such as regime stability, pollution, and political reform.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nAt the end of this course, the ultimate objectives of this course are that students should have a familiarity with and knowledge of \nVietnam from the interplay of the so-called socialist ideology and \u201csocialism-oriented market economy,\u201d \nThe hierarchical structure and decision-making process of the Vietnamese government, \nThe distinctive dynamic of politics, economy, and legal system in Vietnam, and how it differs from other western models. \nThe course improves students\u2019 ability to think about Vietnam\u2019s complex development more comprehensively and critically; and \nIt also enables students to integrate what they have learned into other Vietnam-related courses in their chosen academic (inter-)discipline(s).\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nThe final grade shall be determined as follows:\nAttendance 10%\nParticipation in discussions 10%\nBi-weekly responses 40% (10% each)\nFinal group project (40%) ",

This is required course of VS Major.\n---\nCourse Description: This course introduces students to several crucial aspects of Vietnam Studies as an inter-/trans-disciplinary field and a part of regional studies. Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards. This course is open to VS majors and non-majors.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes: Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\nBecome aware of the work of leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\nContextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\nLocate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam;\nApply transdisciplinary approaches to their research\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\nAttendance & Participation: 20%\nExploring e-resources for Vietnam Studies report: 20%\nPrimary source analysis: 20%\nFinal Essay: 40%",

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts.\nNowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular. Based on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes: Having finished this course, students will:\n1. Have basic knowledge of Vietnamese Literary Chinese (writing, reading, grammar)\n2. Attain a vocabulary of 800 words of Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\n3. Gain the ability to read poems or tales in Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\n4. Establish basic understanding of Vietnamese classical literature and Vietnamese literary Chinese heritage (including Vietnamese Literary Chinese in temples, or at historical sites)\n5. Have greater appreciation of Vietnamese language and culture.\n---\nPossible Assessments & Grading\nAttendance: 15%\nQuizzes: 15%\nMid-term: 20%\nFinal exam: 50%",

In this course, it will be examined from a secular perspective. Taught in a pre-seminar teaching format that combines lectures with in-class discussions, the course employs an interdisciplinary approach that allows students to understand this concept/practice through a variety of lenses, such as history, culture, and applied psychology. Following this direction, Secular mindfulness will be examined historically to see the formation, reconstruction, and transmission of it from wartime Vietnam to the world and back to postwar developing Vietnam. Moreover, during this course, students will have the chance to practice mindfulness and reflect on it in familial, communal, national, and international contexts. In addition to equipping students with academic understanding of and scholarly approaches to secular mindfulness, mindfulness practices introduced in the course may also help students build and develop a healthy mental lifestyle.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes (Vietnam Studies)\nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam; As for Psychology Major (PM), students will be able to examine Mindfulness using major concepts, theoretical perspectives, historical trends, and empirical findings in psychology.\nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers; As for PM, students will be able to work with their peers in Vietnam Studies (VS) to interpret, design, and conduct interdisciplinary research that incorporates basic psychological approach.\nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments; As for PM, students should be able to incorporate sociocultural factors in their psychological research.\nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects; As for PM, students will be able to apply ethical standards to understand secular mindfulness.\nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society.\nCourse Learning Outcomes (Psychology)\nStudents will be able to apply psychological principles to behavioral phenomena through effective written and oral communication of the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, historical trends, and empirical findings in Psychology.\nStudents will be able to interpret, design, and conduct basic psychological research.\nStudents will be able to incorporate sociocultural factors in scientific inquiry when appropriate.\nStudents will be able to apply ethical standards to evaluate and engage in psychological science and practice.\n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nWeek 1\nThich Nhat Hanh\u2019s Engaged Buddhism and Inter-Being\nReading:\nPaul Fuller, An Introduction to Engaged Buddhism, London & New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2022, Chapter 1: \u201cIntroduction: Engaged Buddhism,\u201d 1-21.\nThich Nhat Hanh, \u201cHistory of Engaged Buddhism: A Dharma Talk by Thich Nhat Hanh- Hanoi, Vietnam, May 6-7, 2008,\u201d Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self - Knowledge; Belmont Vol. 6, Iss. 3 (Summer 2008): 29-36.\nMichael C.

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Frederick Dickinson \nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Social Sciences (E2)\nPre-requisite: CORE 101 Global Humanities AND CORE 102 Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society\nReading/Writing: Intensive\n* Cross-listed with History (HIS) Major\n---\nCourse Description:\nHome to four of the five most populous states and four of the five largest economies, the Asia/Pacific is arguably the most dynamic region in the twenty-first century. At the same time, Cold War remnants (a divided Korea and China) and major geopolitical shifts (the rise of China and India, decline of US and Japan) contribute significantly to the volatility of our world. This course will examine the political, economic, and geopolitical dynamism of the region through a survey of relations among the great powers in East Asia from the sixteenth century to the present. Special emphasis will be given to regional and global developments from the perspective of the four principal East Asian states\u2014China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. We will explore the many informal, as well as formal, means of intercourse that have made East Asia what it is today.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n(CLO1) History: Students will develop a broad grasp of East Asian diplomacy and a deep understanding of specific events and historical figures.  \n(CLO2) Reading: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources and between scholarly and non-scholarly texts. They will also learn to critically evaluate texts. \n(CLO3) Expression: Students will hone their skills in both written and oral expression. \n(CLO4) Interpretation: Students will recognize competing narratives and make judgments about such narratives through context and appreciation of historical contingency. \n---\nTentative Syllabus:\nWeek I Introduction \nNo Readings \n\nWeek II \u201cChinese World Order\u201d \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Intro, Chps. 1, 5: Origins; Mature Trajectories (pp. 1-30; 132-49) \nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 1-3 (pp. 3-43) \nPrimary: *\u201cThe Imperial Order and Han Syntheses\u201d (2nd cent, BCE), pp. 283-92 \nWeek III Korean and Japanese appropriation of Chinese World Order (14th-17th cent) \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Chps. 5, 6: Confucian Korea; Warrior Japan; Reunification Japan (pp.149-66; 187-94) \nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 4-8 (pp. 44-104) \nPrimary: *\u201cAdmonition to the New King\u201d (1392), pp. 274-6 \n*Ronald Toby, \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass of Protocol,\u201d pp. 168-197 \n\nWeek IV East Meets West: Canton (18th century), \u201ctreaty port\u201d system (19th century) \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Ming, Qing China; 19th Century Encounter; Treaty Ports (pp. 167-83; 217-25; 230-2) \nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 9-11 (pp. 105-34) \nPrimary: *\u201cLd Macartney\u2019s Cmmssn from Henry Dundas,\u201d etc. (1792-3), pp. 92-109 \n*\u201cMemorial on Legalizing Opium (1836), pp. 110-4 \n Week V Treaty port in Japan and Korea (to 1880s) \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Hermit Kingdom; World Upside Down; 19th Century Opening of Korea; Meiji Restoration (pp. 183-6; 195-8; 235-8; 240-4) \nCai, Miscellany of the South Seas, pp. 14-44 \nPrimary: *\u201dDebates over Open J\u201d (Tokugawa Nariaki, Ii Naosuke [1853]), pp. 281-8 \n*Kim Okkyun, \u201cKapsin Reform Edict\u201d (1884), p. 995-6 \n\nWeek VI 19th Century Border Crossings \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Chp. 8: Domestic Rebellions; Tongzhi Restoration; Meiji Restoration (225-30; 244-51) \nCai, Miscellany, pp. 47-109 \nPrimary: *\u201cJournal of Townsend Harris\u201d (1857-8), pp. 117-22 \n*\u201cYung Wing advises the Taiping and Zeng Guofan\u201d (1859, 63), pp. 150-4 \n\nWeek VII Japanese and American Empires (latter 19th century) \nReadings: \nHolcombe, Chp. 8: 19th Century Opening of Korea (pp. 238-40) \nCai, Miscellany, pp. 111-32 \nPrimary: *Min Yonghwan, \u201cOne Policy out of a Thousand\u201d (1894), pp. 26-34 \n*Alfred T.
