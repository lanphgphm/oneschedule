Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\nLearning Objectives: \nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \n\u2022 Acquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \n\u2022 Adopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \n\u2022 Strengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.",

This course is designed to help students understand basic narrative concepts and to develop storytelling strategies through a variety of moving image formats, including mainstream films and television, documentary films, video art, music videos, advertising, and propaganda. We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art. Students' engagement with these topics will be brought to bear on the final project, either a scripted or video re-working of a film/video work.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Develop a specialized understanding of basic concepts of fictional and non-fictional narrative and narrative construction, such as the power of myth, three-act structure, story circle, as well as elements related to propaganda, advertising, and historical narratives.\n\u00b7      Gain skills in deconstructing narratives and utilizing various tools and strategies to analyze how narratives are instrumentalized.\n\u00b7      Develop proficiency in using advanced concepts related to storytelling and narrative theory to analyze and produce works in diverse media and outputs.\n---\nAssessment & Grading:\n\u2022 Attendance and participation in group discussions -- 20%\n\u2022 Group presentation -- 20%\n\u2022 Written reflection (1,000 - 1,250 words) or video and/or sound reflection (15 min. max) of a moving image work discussed in class -- 25%\n\u2022 Final project: Narrative Remix: Rewrite a scene from a film discussed in class OR make a re-edit of a scene from a film discussed in class -- 35%",

Students must complete all Core courses. \n\nFormat: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: Vietnam presents a rich opportunity for examining the power of imagery in politics, history and society. Rather than study Vietnamese art in a linear chronological fashion, we will examine Vietnamese modern and contemporary art and visual culture through a thematic lens, with a particular focus on what kinds of research methods one can use to study and better understand such visual productions. The selected topics \u2013 including architecture, fashion, ecology, memory, and diaspora - are intended to introduce broader concepts and methods of field research that have resonance within and outside Vietnam. In addition, these concepts will then be animated and contextualized through site and studio visits in order to provide alternative models of research and pedagogy and to illustrate the idea of art as a lived experience. Each unit will be assigned core readings and proposed sites of ethnographic and field research.\n\nLearning Objectives: This course will aim to:\n\u2022 Demonstrate broad knowledge of Vietnamese modern and contemporary arts within national and transnational historical contexts\n\u2022 Understand and employ different methods of field research in art and cultural studies relevant to the context of Vietnam\n\u2022 Develop visual literacy across multiple mediums and forms, including painting, textiles, architecture, and the moving image\n\u2022 Demonstrate skills in critical analysis and persuasive written and oral communication, particularly in relation to images, objects, and the built environment\n---\nTentative Schedule\n1. Colonial arts and architecture (weeks 1-3) / field trip to district 1 and Cho Lon\n2. Fashion (week 4) / field trip to Ao Dai Museum, district 9\n3.

Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero.

For those who haven't enrolled in the Theory part in the Fall term, please enroll for this course in the Summer\n---\nCourse Description: We learn across the Fulbright Core how transformations have happened in human history \u2013 transformations in thought, in social structures, and in individual lives. We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n ---\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading: \nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

How do we write programs that work correctly and can be refactored and improved over time? This course continues and expands on content from Computer Science I, with a greater focus on theoretical concepts, abstraction, and larger programs. Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing and refactoring, basic algorithm analysis, searching and sorting, linear data structures (lists, maps, stacks, and queues), trees, and graphs.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Specially, by the end of the course, you will be able to: \nAbstract data types and data structures\n\u25cfrecall the basic definition and describe applications of common abstract data types (ADTs) such as queues, stacks, lists, sets, maps, priority queues and graphs\n\u25cfchoose the appropriate ADT for modeling a given problem\n\u25cfwrite programs that use the built-in ADTs in the JavaCollections library to solve novel problems, and\n\u25cfcompare alternative implementations of data types(using different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, etc.) with respect to performance.\nAlgorithms and analysis\n\u25cfexplain what is meant by the \"best'' and \"worst'' case behavior of an algorithm,\n\u25cfdetermine informally the time and space complexity of simple algorithms and express your answers in big-O notation,\n\u25cfdiscuss the runtime and memory efficiency of principal algorithms for sorting, searching and hashing,\n\u25cfdetermine whether a recursive or iterative solution is most appropriate for a problem, and\n\u25cfuse recursive backtracking to solve a problem like navigating a maze.\nObject oriented programming\n\u25cfdescribe how references allow for objects to be accessed in multiple ways and accurately diagram the state of a program during execution,\n\u25cfdesign and implement a class, and\n\u25cfuse object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.\nSoftware design\n\u25cfdescribe the benefits of and apply unit testing, refactoring and other software engineering practices, and\n\u25cfapply consistent documentation and program style standards that contribute to the readability and maintainability of software\n\n---\nSchedule of Topics\nCourse Textbook\nWe will be using the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach (5th Edition) by Reges and Stepp. Earlier editions are also acceptable.

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few.\n\nAt the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world's leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\n\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the 'nuts and bolts' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, students should be able to: \nUnderstand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit\nApply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors' as well as the entrepreneurs' point of view\nArticulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums\nExplain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly\n---\nDetailed Sessions Guide\nSession 1: The entrepreneurial journey \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cThe Entrepreneurial Journey\u201d, Stuart Crainer, London Business School  \n\u201cThe Questions Every Entrepreneur Must Answer\u201d, Amar Bidhe, Harvard Business Review, 1996 \nSession 2: Structure of the VC industry: Who\u2019s who and how do VCs make money? \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cA Day in the Life of a Venture Capitalist\u201d (Stanford Case E-44, January 28, 2013) \n\u201c16 Definitions on the Economics of VC\u201d, Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz \n\u201cSix Myths About Venture Capitalists\u201d, Diane Mulcahy, HBS \nChapter 1 \u201cThe Players\u201d and Chapter 10 \u201cHow Venture Capital Funds Work\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson \nSession 3: Developing a fund investment thesis \nRequired Readings:\nChapter 6 \u201cDefining Your Fund\u2019s Investment Strategy\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani \nDoes your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?, David Teten and Stephane Nasser, TechCrunch120 \nCompilation of VC Investment Theses, Alexander Jarvis \nA Short Guide to Impact Investing, The Case Foundation \nSession 4: Deal sourcing and initial selection \nRequired Readings:\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned About Deal Sourcing, Danielle Morrill \nHow VCs Source Deals, Allen Latta  \nIn Defence of the Deck, Bill Gurley  \nChapter 15 \u201cSourcing Investment Opportunities\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \nSession 5: Due diligence \nRequired Readings:\nChapter 16 \u201cThe Art of Conducting Due Diligence\u201d and Chapter 17 \u201cManagement Team Diligence\u201d and Chapter 18 \u201cDiligence beyond Management\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \nImpact Due Diligence: Emerging Best Practices, Pacific Community Ventures \nSession 6: Cap tables and Valuation \nRequired Readings:\n\u201cFinancing New Ventures\u201d (HBS Note N9-811-093, March 28, 2011)  \n\u201cNote on Valuation in Private Company Settings (HBS #9-297-050, April 2002)  \nChapter 7 \u201cThe Capitalization Table\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \nSession 7: Term Sheets and Legal  \nRequired Readings:\nChapters 3 - 6, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \nVenture Capital Lexicon, Series A Term Sheet, Singapore Venture Capital ASsociation (SVCA)  \n\u201cVenture Capital Negotiations: VC versus the Entrepreneur\u201d (HBS # 9-800-170, March 2, 2000) \nSession 8: What happens after the deal is closed: portfolio management through to exit \nRequired Readings:\nHow to Build a Great Startup Board: Part I and II, Reid Hoffman  \n\u201cThe Secret to Making Board Meetings Suck Less\u201d  \nMeasuring and Managing Impact: A Practical Guide, EVPA  \n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nClass contribution and attendance (20%) - based on general participation and in class contributions  \nReflections on in-class dialogues/simulations (30%) \u2013 as mentioned this course will include \u2018dialogues\u2019 and 'simulations' of parts of the investment process.

The recent economic history and political economy of selected Sub-Saharan African countries will be compared with development experience in Southeast Asia, but the important differences between individual African economies will be emphasised and there will be a focus on the performance of specific African sectors, sub-sectors and on the granular detail of economic policy issues.\nStudents will be asked to assess academic publications by development economists, focusing on the theoretical work underpinning most current policy advice and the interventions of international agencies as well as African states. They will be encouraged to develop the self-confidence to criticize this literature, to recognise the range of ideological prejudice it can disguise and to appreciate the weakness of the data used by many economists. Some of the course content and a very large bibliography is available to students by downloading my book on African Economic Development from the website of Oxford University Press (open access).\nThe issues covered will include: Famine, Food Insecurity and Undernutrition; Demographic Change; Gender Relations; Trends in the Terms of Trade and in the Share of World Markets; Trends in Public Sector Investment, in Official Development Assistance Flows and in Foreign Direct Investment; The Quality of Survey data on Poverty, Labour Markets, Households and Farms; Prospects for a Green Revolution; Agricultural Extension, Entrepreneurial Training and Microcredit; Agribusiness, Processing and the Manufacturing Sector. At the end of the course and after discussing each of the above issues, students will be encouraged to draw policy conclusions and to make concrete suggestions for improving policymaking in a specific country.",

This experiential gateway course gives majors and non-majors the chance to explore the tools of historical research and learn what it means to \u201cdo\u201d history. Students will study the roots of historical thinking in Europe and Asia, read and critique the field\u2019s foundational texts, challenge their assumptions about objectivity, and debate the best ways to explore the past. Using Ho Chi Minh City as their laboratory, students will try out the historian\u2019s toolkit and use different methodological approaches to explore history in local, regional, and global contexts. Throughout the course, students will analyze a wealth of primary sources, visit a local archive, conduct oral interviews, experiment with digital history, and design their own research project. This year, Fulbright History Lab will collaborate with Princeton University's History Dialogues Project to provide students an introduction to oral history methods, research ethics, and project design. As part of this semester-long module, students will have the opportunity to interact with students from Princeton's partner institutions around the world. Following the completion of this course, students will be eligible to carry out the research proposals they design in Fulbright History Lab over the summer as part of the History Dialogues Project's optional Independent Research Seminar.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students will:\n1.Understand and explain the principal concepts of historical thinking: context, change over time, complexity, causality, and contingency\n2.Recognize, differentiate, and apply different methodological approaches (e.g. social, cultural, gender, micro, global, environmental, etc.)\n3.Demonstrate familiarity with different research methods used in history (archival, oral, quantitative) and identify key issues in research ethics (e.g. consent, copyright, and plagiarism)\n4.Learn how to access, use, and analyze visual, textual, literary, oral, and archival sources\n5.Design an independent oral research project and present a proposal for its implementation\n---\nCourse Schedule\nReadings and Resources: All readings and course materials are available on our Canvas pages.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\n5. Propose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\n6. Critically analyze and interpret primary sources\n7. Clearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\n---\nClass Schedule\nWeek 1:\nStart Unit 1: The Cold War \nDiscuss Rubric and Assignment Guide for Assignment 1 \nKnow-What-Learn (KWL) to assess your knowledge of the Cold War and identify learning goals for this unit. \nYou will individually fill out the first two columns of a KWL chart\u2014what do you know about the Cold War?

Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated. Throughout the course students will engage with contemporary writings and study primary source documents which will accompany each topic.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students on the course will have as their objectives:\n1. To understand the changing place of nuclear weapons in US foreign and defence policy since the Second World War\n2. To examine the influence of nuclear issues on US domestic politics and culture from the initiation of an American atomic bomb programme to the end of the Cold War\n3. To analyse critically primary source materials, including historical documents from the period studied. \n4. To interpret visual and oral material related to the main themes of the course.\n5. To examine topics through means of oral presentations given to the class\n6.

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely appreciate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies. We hope by the end, students will treasure the beauty of light and explore it as a sustainable solution for our common home, the Earth. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u2022 Some includes, but not limited to,  \n\u2022 Understand the nature of light\n\u2022 Understand how light is produced, how they interact with matter, how we can manipulate them \n\u2022 Recognize the technical application of the light in the daily assets such as microwave, camera, x-ray\u2026\n\u2022 Practical skills to handle the light source and light sensor\n\u2022 Computing and data anlysis skills\n---\nTentative Syllabus\nTentative syllabus: for 6 hours/week in 8 weeks.

Some key materials have shaped our world, literally and figuratively, so much so that we named different eras of human civilization after them: the Stone Age, the Iron Age, the Bronze Age\u2026 and now, we\u2019re in the Semiconductor Age. What is the future then?\nIn this course, we will learn about important materials, their history, production, and properties. What makes paper, cloth, and plastic so different even though they are all organic polymers? What is the magic key step in both steel and semiconductor production? What properties make copper a great material for electronics and statues? Each material has its story full of ups and downs that involves not only science but also culture and economics. Their distinctive properties influence their usage in manufacturing and arts. How might these stories connect to you? What would be a perfect material in your opinion? We will explore questions like these, do some experiments, and have you look at the materials that make up your own living environment. We will also talk about pigments, which is a bit nontraditional for a material course, but I love them. And what is a world without colors, right?\n---\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\u2022 Name the main classes of materials and their basic characteristics.\n\u2022 Understand the main properties of materials, why each material has such properties, and some testing methods.\n\u2022 Understand the interconnection between advances in material science and human history.\n\u2022 Be aware of the issues associated with each material and potential ways to improve.\n---\nCourse Schedule\nTexts and Other Instructional Materials:\nTextbooks: \nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach, 5th Edition by William D.

Instrumental analysis is crucial in conducting scientific research, evaluating the quality of materials including food and drinks, assessing environmental pollution and assisting forensic investigation, to name a few. In this courses, students will learn the science and conduct small projects using common instrumental techniques. They include Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Inverted Microscope (IM), Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and potentially others. FTIR is used to analyze chemical compositions and chemical bonds of a sample. IM with camera magnifies physical, chemical and biological processes happening in micrometer scale to observe and capture. RT-PCR monitors the amplification reaction of a targeted DNA molecule which can be used in numerous applications, such as quantifying microbial and vial load in a sample for the diagnostic of infectious diseases. ICP-OES is used to qualify and quantify chemical elements of a sample, especially metals. FTIR, IM and RT-PCR are available at Fulbright's lab. ICP-OES and other techniques are available at our collaborated labs and company.\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, students will:\n\u2022 Demonstrate understanding of fundamental knowledge behind five instrumental analysis techniques: FTIR, Inverted Microscope, RT-PCR, ICP-OES and potentially others\n\u2022 Demonstrate practical skills about using the above instruments\n\u2022 Utilize software to visualize, analyze and calculate physical and chemical properties of molecules and materials using the above techniques\n\u2022 Analyze data and present experimental data\n\u2022 Writing scientific lab reports\n---\nCourse Schedule\nTextbooks:\nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach, 5th Editionby William D.

This is an introductory course and our focus will thus be broad. We will cover a wide range of texts from antiquity to the present day, from Ancient Greece to Jacobean England, Victorian England, French Indochina and the contemporary U.S. In doing so our aim will be to understand texts intertextually \u2013 to become alive to the ways that poems and prose draw on, and break from, longstanding literary traditions. We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it. We will read with the understanding that all of these ways of reading are mutually inclusive. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon course completion, students: \n\u2022 Will be able to explain the historical significance of several major literary traditions and their interrelations \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate the formal qualities of poetry, prose, and drama \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate key problems in texts\u2019 representations of individualism and civic responsibility \n\u2022 Will be able to engage in constructive peer review (as both reviewer and reviewee) in order to create effective and sound written and spoken analytical texts\n---\nCourse Schedule\nClass 1 \nTasks to do before class: Show up \nTopics/Activities: Introduction; syllabus \u2013 Introduction to Ancient Greece and the world of The Odyssey\nClass 2\nTasks to do before class: \nRead: The Odyssey, Book 1-12\nWrite: Weekly Canvas response posting (Due Saturday)\nTopics/Activities: \nEpic Poetry Oral traditions in print \nTelemachus\u2019 story \nCivil assembly in the leaderless state \nThe qualities of a king \nOdysseus\u2019 story \nThe wily strategist \nArete \nHospitality \nWine, the wine-dark sea, and the polis\nClass 3  \nTasks to do before class: \nRead: The Odyssey, Books 13-24 \nWrite: Weekly Canvas response posting (due Saturday) \nDue: Micro-assignment #1 \nTopics/Activities: \nIthacan homecoming \nOdysseus as artificer \nTests and trials \nPenelope\u2019s story \nClass 4 \nTasks to do before class:\nRead: Antigone \nWrite: Weekly Canvas response posting (due Saturday)\nTopics/Activities:\nAntigone \nAncient Greece and classical drama \nHow would you stage Antigone?  \nAristotle\u2019s theory of tragedy\nClass 5\nTasks to do before class: \nRead: Marie de France, \u201cGuigemar,\u201d \u201cLe Fresne,\u201d \u201cBisclavret,\u201d \u201cLanval,\u201d and \u201cYonec.\u201d Read Penguin Classics edition (translated by Burgess and Busby).

K. Rowling, Ralph Ellison, Italo Calvino, and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Our texts will be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Invisible Man, Invisible Cities, and The Sympathizer. We will examine theories of identity and otherness, and discover the origin of the Invisibility Cloak. \n---\nLearning Outcomes: \nWe will read the entirety of Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Committed, his 2021 sequel to the Pulitzer Prize winning book The Sympathizer. (It is not necessary to have read the first book, since the plot is helpfully recapitulated in the opening section.) The Committed is a searing indictment of colonialism, and presents a nameless narrator who is split into three separate selves. We will also read the beginning third of Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, the 1952 masterpiece on which The Committed is very loosely based. Like Nguyen, Ellison introduces a nameless narrator whose internal conflicts threaten to tear him apart. We will read most of J. K. Rowling\u2019s brilliant treatment of the subject of otherness and belonging, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone (originally published in 1997 as Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone), which painfully exposes the divide between wizards and humans. Additional texts introducing other theoretical angles on the question of invisibility will be brought in as necessary. Students will be evaluated on four things: 1) class participation throughout the course, 2) a short presentation, 3) five written responses keyed to the readings, and 4) two written papers, the first analyzing a small shared aspect of the texts, and the second providing an opportunity for a broader perspective on what is a wide-ranging subject of inexhaustible interest to human beings.\n---\nCourse Schedule\nTexts:\nJ.

How can an admission system match applicants to the best-suited university based on their preference and exam results? The answers to these questions arise from the study of Discrete Mathematics, which is a branch of Mathematics that deals with entities like integers, sets, graphs with distinct and separate values. The properties of discrete objects and structures play an essential role in many fields such as Theoretical Computer Science, Probability, Statistics, and Cryptography. This course will provide basic knowledge of Combinatorics and Graph theory along with various methods of mathematical reasoning. Students will practice producing and writing formal rigorous proofs. Major topics in this course include set theory, Combinatorial counting methods, Graph theory (Eulerian walk, Hamiltonian cycle, Spanning Tree, Planar graph, etc.).\n---\nCourse Goals:\n\u2022 Learn how to construct precise mathematical proofs so as to develop rigorous reasoning skills that may be transferred to other disciplines. \n\u2022 Learn selected concepts and techniques from Discrete Mathematics, in particular graph theory, with an emphasis on topics germane to the study of computer science.\n---\nCourse Schedule\nTextbook and References \nMain text: Invitation to Discrete Mathematics, 2nd by Jiri Matousek and Jaroslav Nesetril, Oxford University Press, 2016.

If so, welcome to Dev. Psy! Developmental psychology or Lifespan Development is the study of human\u2019s development process and different factors that may have an influence on one\u2019s development. Students will gain perspectives on how brain and physical, cognitive and linguistic, emotional, sociocultural, moral, and spiritual developments change across the life span\u2014from prenatal through late adulthood or from \u201cwomb to tomb.\u201d Important topics that may affect human development, such as the role of family and other relationships, the development of self-in-context, and unique aspects of aging and bereavement will be discussed. This course is designed particularly to engage students in conversations around human development in the context of Vietnam and Vietnamese culture in order to start to compare and contrast it with the contemporary understandings and research of various developmental psychology theories and topics\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nAfter finishing this course, students should be able to:\n1.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.  \n---\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\n\u2022 Comprehend social and cultural developments in relation to youth\u2019s place and role in Vietnam and Asia;\n\u2022 Use basic concepts and theories of youth from social and cultural sciences;\n\u2022 Read critically the literature and other materials;\n\u2022 Write and present academic research reports; and\n\u2022 Reflect upon youth\u2019s relationships with the state and society in Vietnam and Asia.\n---\nCourse Outline\nWeek 1: Introduction - Film discussion\nWeek 2: Youth: concepts and theories\nWeek 3: Youth in Asia\u2019s modern history\nWeek 4: Youth in contemporary Asia: Northeast Asia\nWeek 5: Youth in contemporary Asia: Southeast Asia\nWeek 6: Youth and the state - Youth as citizens\nWeek 7: Midterm quiz/exam - Film discussion\nWeek 8: Youth and economic development - Youth and work\nWeek 9: Youth and political participation - Youth and political representation\nWeek 10: Youth and identity - Youth and gender\nWeek 11: Research project presentations and peer-reviews\nWeek 12: Youth and culture - Field research (Group)\nWeek 13: Youth and digital world - Field research (Individual)\nWeek 14: Research findings presentations and peer-reviews\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nClass participation -- 20%\nMidterm quiz/exam -- 20%\nResearch Project Presentation -- 10%\nResearch findings presentations -- 20% \nFinal essay -- 30%",

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. \nThe aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. \nBuilding on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a digital exhibition via OMEKA that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This digital exhibition also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century.\n---\nLearning Objectives: \n\u2022 introduction to theories and methodologies in history/art history/architecture (e.g., critical source analysis; discourse theory; structuralist- and post-structuralist approaches; frame and framing theories; image theory; social space theory; affordances; actor-object-networks; object-biography) [scientific competences]\n\u2022 introduction to digital tool OMEKA (basic html-programming skills; cross-linking; design of digital maps, timelines, audio-video-files etc.) [digital humanities comp.]\n\u2022 analysis of selected urban spaces and Graeco-Roman artifacts with respective research literature [scientific comp.]\n\u2022 interpretation of innate narratives of the selected sources in critical manner [transfer and critical engagement comp.]\n\u2022 creation of digital exhibition (by application of skills aquired from steps before) [digital humanities comp.]\n\u2022 organisation and management of complex group-work (assignment of tasks and responsibilities; feedback culture; presentation skills etc.) [social and organizational comp.]\n\u2022 audience-oriented presentation and marketing of digital exhibition (writing of appealing texts; balanced text-image-relation; logo / corporate identity design; etc.) [organizational and transfer comp., media comp.]\n---\nCourse Outline\nTopic/Content: Introduction to the topic \nForm: Team-building activity / first orientation & examples\nTopic/Content: Introduction to Historical Source Criticism\nForm: Reflection on historical analysis and interpretation I\nReading: J.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the \u201cnew woman\u201d pushed against the limits imposed by society. Following the footsteps of their counterparts in Europe and North America, the East Asian \u201cnew woman\u201d emerged during the interwar period seeking autonomy, redefining the feminine, exploring new ideas, lifestyles and behavior, and negotiating between the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201cmodern\u201d. More than a century has passed but women of the 21stcentury still find themselves facing the challenges of negotiating between dominant gender roles and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. The course focuses on the dilemmas that women had to and still have to deal with in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression. In doing so, it specifically considers various structural, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped and transformed new womanhood of the early modern period and the 21stcentury. Throughout the semester, students will consider how social structures and cultural practices have affected women and also how women themselves have struggled for equal status and rights. Among others, the course explores various ways, resources, and outcomes of women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. Students will examine a variety of texts with the aim of investigating the continuity and change in narrations on new womanhood in general and in Asia in particular.\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\nComprehend the historical context in which the \u201cnew woman\u201d emerge during the early modern period;\nRelate women\u2019s variegated experiences of emerging as the \u201cnew woman\u201d in the public sphere to specific national, regional and global contexts;\nUnderstand women\u2019s dilemmas in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression in the early modern and 21st-century context;\nDevelop analytical skills in examining women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination; and,\nWrite and present academic research reports.\n---\nCourse Outline\nWeek 1: Introduction\nFilm discussion: \u201cTokyo Story\u201d by Ozu Yasujiro (1953)or \u201cSweet Dream\u201d by Ju-nam Yang (1936)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmd_OBPFll8\nWeek 2: Women, education, and modern technology\nWeek 3: Women, consumption, and agency\nWeek 4: Women and modernity in early modern period\nWeek 5: \u201cNew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\nWeek 6: Colonialism, nationalism, and the \u201cwise mother, good wife\u201d ideology\nWeek 7: Midterm exam\nFilm discussion: \u201cYeongja\u2019s Heyday\u201d by Ho Sun Kim (1975) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPoTeWINSg\nWeek 8: Women, development, and the state\nWeek 9: Women, work, and power\nWeek 10: Women, feminism, and the \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement\nWeek 11: \u201cTiger mother\u201d vs. \u201cparasite single\u201d(parasaito shinguru) and\u201cKimchi woman\u201d (kimchinyeo)\nWeek 12: Panel discussion 1: \u201cnew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\nPanel discussion2: love, marriage, and new womanhood\nWeek 13: Panel discussion3: women and the state\nPanel discussion 4: women, feminism, and nationalism\nWeek 14: Group project presentations\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nClass participation (20%)\nMidterm exam (20%)\nGroup Project (30%)\nFinal essay (30%)",

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  \nCore concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English\nLearning Objectives: Students Will Be Able To (SWBAT): \n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nClass Participation -- 20%\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\nArticle Review -- 10%\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%",

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \n---\nCourse Readings:\nThere is no textbook for this course.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.\n---\nLearning Objectives: There are 3 basic Learning Objectives of this course:\nHelping students understand Vietnamese cultural heritage better through Vietnamese literary Chinese texts.\nHelping students to learn Sino-Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters along with standard modern Chinese dictions, and to use Sino-Vietnamese words more accurately and effectively in modern Vietnamese language.\nHelping students have a broader view of the culture and history of East Asian Cultural Sphere / Kanji Cultural Sphere.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nAttendance: 15%\nQuizzes: 20%\nMid-term: 15%\nFinal exam: 50%",

Documentaries are always grounded in real life, and make a claim to tell us something worth knowing about it.\u201d Therefore, social issues of national identity, collective memory, gender, the diaspora will be effectively communicated to the audience through the visual expression of documentary storytelling.\nThis course is directed to students who like watching documentaries and hope to make documentaries. The teaching team including Vietnamese documentary researchers and filmmakers will help students to focus on analyzing selected documentaries and practical filmmaking training. Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing. One of the course\u2019s features is that its students will make a documentary film based on Vietnamese cultural and social materials exposed to them during the course. At the end of the course, students will submit a documentary film in which academic knowledge can be utilized and integrated.\n---\nLearning Objectives: This course will aim to:\n\u2022 The ability to evaluate a documentary film\n\u2022 Understanding the values of national documentary film and the relation between cinema and national identities.\n\u2022 Understanding how to explore and handle cultural and social materials in making a documentary film\n\u2022 Finding suitable storytelling tools and aesthetic viewpoints for a filmmaker\u2019s discourse\n\u2022 Finding a suitable style to produce their films.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n\u2022 Be able to analyze a documentary film and write critically about how the film presents its aesthetic form and communicates its meaning\n\u2022 Understanding the history of documentary film and identifying conventions and elements of a documentary film\n\u2022 Understanding current debates about documentary ethics and aesthetics.\n\u2022 Prepare and submit their own documentary film in appropriate storytelling\n---\nCourse schedule\nRequired Materials\nBernard, Sheila Curran (2004) Documentary Storytelling for Video and Filmmakers.

Form is an indispensable part of any movie because it decides the final work. Different films approach thesame content/theme in various ways. Those aesthetic forms concern the editing, the cinematography, the sound layers in narrating the story.
