    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Sven Gunther & Elizabeth Gunther\nLevel: Intermediate\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No\nCourse Format: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: The rich culture of nowadays Vietnam is deeply entangled with various histories the country faced in the course of times. Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. The aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. Building on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a mobile app that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This app also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century..  ",

Those systems are composed of many parts that have their own behaviors and interact with each other to form the integrated behaviors as the whole. Computer modeling and simulation can assist us to better understand, design, create and/or evaluate such complex systems. In this course, we will learn and practice some of the most common approaches in developing mathematical models of such systems and then implement the models in Python to simulate the systems computationally to make it possible to investigate their behaviors and quantitative performance in well-designed scenarios. The students are encouraged to work in groups on term-projects of which the topics may be a mechanical system, a natural process or a disease's transmission in a certain area.",

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn \nLevel: Foundation\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No freshmen accepted\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nCourse Format: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: Vietnamese Literary Chinese is an important part of the formation of Vietnamese culture and ideology. Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.",

Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing.

Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero. All late take-home assignments are subject to a 3% penalty every 24 hours. Generally, late assignments will not be accepted after one week.\n Participation: 20%\nWeekly Response Postings: 20%\nWriting Assignment #1 \u2013 the Outline: 20%\nWriting Assignment #2: 20%\nWriting Assignment #3: 20%",

Bi-weekly class discussions will be based on substantial weekly readings (100 pp./week) in poetry, fiction, memoir, film, and essays that anchor the class\u2019s exploration of how a scattered and war-displaced people (re)constructs identities, communities, and memories through cultural representations in literature and film. Students will examine, discuss, and write about works by American, Canadian-, and Australian-Vietnamese writers, directors, and scholars. While by no means a theory-heavy course, this literature seminar will introduce students to the interdisciplinary academic field and key texts of ethnic and diasporic studies. The course is divided into six modules of roughly 2-3 weeks in length each to thematize readings around the following topic clusters: (1) Memory, Displacement, and Nostalgia; (2) Auto-Narrative and Identity; (3) Diasporic Overseas Communities; (4) Generational Conflict and Assimilation Issues; (5) Race, Labor, Gender, and Class; and (6) Re-imagining Viet Nam\u2019s Past and Future. Each module ends with an optional film screening to be scheduled outside of class hours as a capstone. ",

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam.  The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \n---\nCourse Readings:\nThere is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles.\nTentative Course Schedule\nWeek 1: Introduction to comparative politics / Comparative method\nLijphart, Arend.

Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.",

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few. At the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world's leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the 'nuts and bolts' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \"do things\". Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity. Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d? or an insult? Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human. This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics. These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.\n Please note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.",

Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely apprecicate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection.

Rooted in geography, intellectual traditions and history, these ideas are vital to moulding regionally distinctive identities, biographies, and patterns of change. This course examines conceptions of power and selfhood in mainland Southeast Asia. The investigation moves from remote mountain valleys to bustling coastal ports, and from the village to the palace, tracing the foundations of royal power, political community, conflict, resistance, and belonging. The course explores what it means to be a person in Southeast Asia, and how people are ritually incorporated into bodies, families, social statuses, networks, and nations. Most examples in the course are drawn from the 'Indianized' societies of Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, however, case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia feature, as do those drawn from Vietnam and Southern China. Course participants will gain insights into the socio-cultural dynamics of Vietnam's close neighbours and the comparative study of societies and cultures.

    "description": "Visiting Faculty: Matthew Jones\nLevel: Advanced\nCredits: 04 credits\nPre-requisite: No\nCourse Format: On-campus\n---\nCourse Description: This course looks at the way nuclear weapons and the challenges they have posed have influenced the course of American foreign and defence policy, strategic thinking, and domestic politics, from the instigation of the Manhattan project \u2013 the US program to develop an atomic bomb \u2013 to the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and a little beyond. Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.",

Rather than study Vietnamese art in a linear chronological fashion, we will examine Vietnamese modern and contemporary art and visual culture through a thematic lens. The course will be organized through topical units - such as architecture, fashion, socialism, memorials, diaspora, and ecology - that are intended to introduce broader concepts and relevant methods of field research that have resonance within and outside Vietnam. These concepts will be animated and contextualized through film screenings, field trips to cultural sites, and studio visits with artists. Through such on-site encounters, students will be encouraged to explore alternative methods of research and to better understand the idea of art as a lived experience.

Drawing from fiction, film, memoir, news articles, poems, cartoons, and historical and feminist works, we will analyze women\u2019s contributions to warfare in the following roles: as mothers, nurses, wives, resistance fighters, base workers, sex workers, war brides, anti-war protestors, journalists, humanitarians, soldiers, and political leaders. Students taking this course will gain a deeper appreciation of Vietnamese and U.S. women\u2019s history and the issues surrounding women\u2019s portrayals as nurturers, breeders, protected others, betrayers, victims, consumers, sexual provocateurs, and woman warriors.Through class discussions, presentations, and writing assignments, students will develop skills to critically interpret women\u2019s real and fantasized relationships to modern wars. Students will also develop a vocabulary in gender and feminist studies through the applied use of terms and concepts like gender construction, differences between gender and sex, gender performance, gender non-conformity, intersectionality, interpellations between societal gender and war structures, and the mobilization of gendered identities for militarized purposes in the U.S. and Vietnam during the Vietnam War Er.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts.
