We will investigate how the discipline of art history began to take shape as early as the 17th century, and focus on the key theoretical investigations and methods of interpretation that have informed the study of art through the present. Such approaches include connoisseurship, iconography, semiology, Marxism, feminism, poststructuralism, visual culture, and postcolonial studies. Important questions that will surface throughout our discussions include the relationship of artistic form to context, the very notion of art as history, and the possibilities and challenges of a truly 'global' art history. Assessments and activities will encourage students to think of theory as method, and to apply these lenses of interpretation to objects and images of study.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nAfter finishing this course, students should be able to:\nIdentify key authors and texts associated with art historical methodologies and theoretical frameworks\nDemonstrate visual and theoretical literacy relevant to the study of art and art history\nCritically assess how historical approaches to interpreting art can be situated interdisciplinarily\nApply art historical methods through spoken and written argumentation\nDemonstrate knowledge and skills applicable to art historical scholarship, curatorship, and other industry and academic fields\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nParticipation - 15%\nWeekly pr\u00e9cis with dated annotations (6 in total, approx. 300-400 words each) \u2013 25%\nGroup Presentation \u2013 20%\nFinal paper proposal, preliminary bibliography, and presentation \u2013 10%\nFinal paper (approx. 1000 words) \u2013 30%",

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nDemonstrate a basic understanding of the video making process. Develop comprehension of non-linear editing concepts and practical competency in the usage of non-linear video-editing software. Develop skills in basic script writing format and an understanding of filmic narrative structure. Demonstrate competency in oral presentation and studio critique. Acquire introductory knowledge of seminal video artworks and experimental films.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nAttendance and Participation - 15%\nVideo Project, Individual: One video with duration of less than 5-minutes made using only found footage - 30%\nPresentation and critique session for 5-minute video - 10%\nFinal video project, Individual: One final video with duration of less than 10 minutes, using footage shot by the student - 35%\nPresentation and critique session for 10-minute video final project - 10%",

After the past few years upheaval and distress, this suggestion may no longer seem very far-fetched. Concerns about social, ecological, and technological crises, when thematized, however, are often relegated to genres of fiction suggesting a certain departure from reality. If our circumstances have become similar to a \u201cwork of science fiction,\u201d then we must also take a closer look at how works of not just science fiction, but also horror and fantasy, rely on the boundaries between familiar and unfamiliar\u2014enabling us to imagine and cognitively process difficult questions that at first, seem uncanny and estranged from our lives.\nIn this course, we will examine film and media primarily from East Asia that are concerned with the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Through different genres of media, we examine how bodies, spaces, and even the Earth itself\u2014that we take for granted as familiar entities\u2014can become uncanny, strange, and alien. Our class discussion will take us from questions of environmental crisis and neo-imperialism in Bong Joon Ho\u2019s spin on the monster film genre in The Host, through the politics of the self and the boundaries between human and machine in Mamoru Oshii\u2019s Ghost in the Shell, and Huang Jianxin\u2019s Dislocation, to concerns about the end of the Anthropocene and human dominance over Earth in Chi Hui\u2019s The Rainforest and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind. This course will introduce students to a wide range of East Asian language film and media materials in translation. No previous knowledge of the region is required.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nAnalyze films and texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and other formal techniques \nWrite, construct, and present analyses into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats \nConduct and present research in the art and media humanities \nCreate original arguments that address the larger questions of the course \nRevise and incorporate feedback and comments into projects and assignments from peers and instructors.\n---\nTentative Course Syllabus\n(topics to be reduced) \n\nWeek 1 \u2013 Introductions and the Uncanny \nSigmund Freud, \u201cThe \u2018Uncanny\u2019\u201d (1919), 219-226, 238-252 \nDuke University Writing Studio, \u201cWriting about Film\u201d \n\nWeek 2 \u2013 Heterotopias and the Monster \nBong Joon Ho, The Host \nTimothy Corrigan, Writing About Film. \u201cPreparing to watch and preparing to write\u201d and \u201cApproaches to Writing about Film\u201d \nHye Jean Chung - Chapter 4: Heterotopic Monstrosity: The Host and Godzilla, 105-129 \n\nWeek 3 \u2013 The science fiction cityscape \nHao Jingfang, \u201cFolding Beijing\u201d \nMarilyn Fabe, \u201cFilm Glossary\u201d \nLiao, Wang. \"The Alienation of Spaces in Future China: The Case of Hao Jingfang's Folding Beijing.\" Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 57, No. 4, 2020, 686-701.  \n\nWeek 4 \u2013 Science fiction and Lost love \nWong Kar Wai, 2046 \nDonna Haraway: \u201cA Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s,\u201d 1-37 \n\nWeek 5 - Politics of the Cyborg self \nMamoru Oshii, Ghost in the Shell (1995) \nChristopher Bolton, Chapter 3 Puppet Voices, Cyborg Souls; pg 95-128 \n\nWeek 6 \u2013 Science fiction and Trauma \nJang Joon-hwan, Save the Green Planet \nChu, Seo-young.

The emphasis will be on thinking of sound as an artistic material and focusing on its expressive possibilities for generating physical and mental spaces. Students will be introduced to and have ample opportunity to gain proficiency with different hardware and software for both field and studio recordings. The practical and theoretical knowledge learnt in this course, paired with site visits and active listening sessions, are for developing a critical appreciation of sound and for creating self-directed projects.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nStudents will acquire an in-depth understanding of the history, theory and practice of sound-making in modern and contemporary art from multiple perspectives.  \nStudents will also be expected apply critical and technical skills in defining their own sonic statement. Students will be able to explain key concepts in sound art and conduct applied listening exercises. Students will be able to demonstrate technical understanding of recording device and editing software. \nThe learning outcomes for this course correspond to the major\u2019s learning outcomes of understanding and using the (sonic) image as a vehicle of communication and expression; clear and persuasive writing and verbal expression; identification of important theories in art history and media studies. \nThe course learning outcomes are appropriate for an upper-division course in its focus on reading theory, more advanced level of analyzing and producing acoustic works of art, and training in digital technologies.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nParticipation/Attendance - 20%\nAssignment 1 (individual presentations) - 10%\nAssignment 2 (mono/stereo work) - 20%\nAssignment 3 (homework) - 15%\nAssignment 4 (final project) - 35%",

Corey - Email: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\nCategory: Independent Study\nPre-requisite(s): 2 x 200-level courses in any subject\n* Cross-listed with Literature (LIT)\n---\nCourse Description:\nThis advanced directed readings course enables Art & Media Studies students interested in theory to develop an immersive and deconstructive approach to challenging theoretical texts, particularly those emerging from writing on art (and particularly the modern and contemporary). Suggested writers and art theorists might include Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Claire Bishop, Walter Mignolo, Jacques Derrida, Thierry deDuve, and Geeta Kapur. Students will propose their choices of texts and develop a reading list in collaboration with their classmates and the instructor, and each week will be devoted to carefully thinking through the language, ideas, and images generated by the texts. Emphasis will be placed on slowing and breaking down the ways in which we search for and produce meaning in reading and through our own writing. Students will create an individualized assessment plan in consultation with the instructor, and while discussion and participation will be substantially weighted, other assessments may take the form of annotated bibliographies, long and short essay forms, creative and curatorial writing, in addition to the realization of artistic works.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nStudents will develop strategies for reading, understanding, explaining, and responding to challenging theoretical texts\nStudents will gain familiarity with important writers and theorists in art history and related disciplines\nStudents will deepen their understanding of theoretical approaches such as deconstruction, postformalism, and related poststructuralist methodologies\nStudents will demonstrate their understanding and application of theoretical method through written and creative assessments\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nAssessments will include presentations and other forms of substantial writing and artistic production, the parameters of which will be individually developed in consultation with the instructor.\nThis project will be graded in Letter grade.",

Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero. All late take-home assignments are subject to a 3% penalty every 24 hours. Generally, late assignments will not be accepted after one week.\n Participation: 20%\nWeekly Response Postings: 20%\nWriting Assignment #1 \u2013 the Outline: 20%\nWriting Assignment #2: 20%\nWriting Assignment #3: 20%",

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n ---\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading: \nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\n---\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\n---\nCourse Materials:\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas. Please do note that the course materials should be used for personal studying purpose. This means you must not upload or share them onto the public sites such as Facebook, Google sites and so on.\nMain references\nThe following two books will be used in the course depending on the topics of interest.\n[1].

This course is reading- and writing-intensive and is organized as a series of discussions. This course focuses on two main aspects: (i) the analysis of economic inequalities and (ii) the interaction between inequality and economic development. It will address the following questions from a theoretical perspective and/or an empirical perspective: \n1. How does inequality evolve over time, and how does the evolution of inequality couple with the dynamics of economic development? \n2. What are the determinants of inequality, and which theories can account for the level of economic inequalities and its dynamics?  \n3. Which public policies can reduce inequality and foster equitable growth?  \n4.

The aim of this course is to develop an understanding of the basic concepts of robotics, focusing on the construction and programming of autonomous mobile robots. The course uses a studio-based approach that tightly combines instruction in theory with practical implementation. After a review of recent developments in robotics, students are introduced to fundamental concepts related to robot mechanics, kinematics, sensor systems, and motion control. They are then introduced to high-level concepts related to robot intelligence such as path planning, localization, and map building. Students are also taught essential concepts and skills of programming. Both the robotic concepts and programming skills are reinforced as they work in a supervised, hands-on, team-based project. In this project, students work in teams to apply the conceptual knowledge and skills that they have acquired to the task of building and programming a robot in hands-on sessions. Students develop their project in the framework of the engineering design process\u2014from the analysis of requirements and initial design to implementation and testing. The course concludes with a contest designed for the robots developed by students. \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO):\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to \nCLO1: Understand fundamental concepts of intelligent robot systems that will help them better understand the design and development challenges in the field of robotics. \nCLO2: Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, construction and control of robots. \nCLO3: Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills. \nCLO4: Gain hands-on practice in building and programming an actual robot. \nCLO5: Program an autonomous mobile robot to achieve challenging tasks. \nCLO6: Work as a team to complete different learning tasks that include practical and team assignments \nCLO7: Effectively communicate their results via professional report writing and presentation \nCLO8: Sharpens their analytical, planning, presentation and teamwork skills  \n\nEngineering Major Learning Outcomes (MLO):\nMLO1: Analytical thinking: Identify, formulate, analyze and decompose complex engineering problems along with available resources and authentic constraints using principles of mathematics, basic sciences and engineering sciences.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world.

Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\n5. Propose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\n6. Critically analyze and interpret primary sources\n7. Clearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\n---\nTentative Class Schedule\nWeek 1:\nStart Unit 1: The Cold War \nDiscuss Rubric and Assignment Guide for Assignment 1 \nKnow-What-Learn (KWL) to assess your knowledge of the Cold War and identify learning goals for this unit. \nYou will individually fill out the first two columns of a KWL chart\u2014what do you know about the Cold War?

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas.  \nThis course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?  \nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict. \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): On completion of this module, students should be able to do the following (numbers of Major Learning Outcomes are attached in parentheses; see list of MLOs below): \nCLO1: Identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War (MLO 1) \nCLO2: Explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.

At least one 200-level course in History or Social Studies \nReading/Writing: Intensive\nCross-listed with Vietnamese Studies (VS) and Social Studies (SS)\n---\nCourse Description:\nWe tend to think of the world in terms of nations, kingdoms, and empires. What does the world look like from the margins between states? The field of borderland studies puts those margins at the center of inquiry. In this course, we will learn how historically \u201cfuzzy\u201d borderlands in the Asia Pacific region became precisely bordered lands, or in some cases, disputed territories, in our contemporary world. We will also read from ethnographies and histories of everyday life to gain a deeper appreciation of life on the edges of the state. Readings will address a broad swathe of Asia with an emphasis on the borderlands between various states and the Qing empire as well as its successor states, including the PRC. Case studies will include Japanese-Ainu relations, Chinese migration to the Mekong delta, the making of Siam\u2019s modern borders, territorial disputes in Kashmir and Tibet, journeys through Mongolia, everyday life along the China-Russia border, and more. \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nIn this course, students will develop \nCritical thinking skills: We will challenge conventional frameworks for thinking about geographical space and human communities\u2014particularly, we will think critically about the framework of the neatly-bounded nation-state. \nReasoning skills: we will think intensively about the best way to balance different kinds of evidence, including textual primary sources, maps, and participant observation data, while revising our image of the past and present.  \nCultural knowledge: We will consider how life varies from one borderland to the next, and how life in borderlands may differ from life in the interior of a state\u2014particularly in the metropole. \nEffective communication: Students will develop their writing and oral presentation skills with a historiographical paper, a research paper, and a final presentation. \n---\nTentative Course Syllabus\n\nWeek 1: What does a \u201cBorderland\u201d Look Like? \nReadings: Elizabeth Kimball Kendall, A Wayfarer in China, ch. 6, \u201cTachienlu.\u201d \n Unit 1: Frontiers and Borderlands \n Week 2: Origins of the Field: Perspectives from North America \nFrederick Jackson Turner (1920), The Frontier in American History, chapter 1. \nJeremy Adelman and Stephen Aron (1999), \u201cFrom Borderlands to Borders: Empires, Nation-States, and the Peoples in Between in North American History.\u201d \n Week 3: Comparative Asian Perspectives \nReadings: Michiel Baud and Willem Van Schendel (1997), \u201cToward a Comparative History of Borderlands.\u201d \nC.

        "description": "Faculty: Elsa Costa - E: elsa.costa@fulbright.edu.vn\nPre-requisite: At least one 200-level course with substantial seminar discussion; HIS105 Global History Lab or at least one course with a European or (North or South) American history component 1500-1950, or permission from the instructor.  \nCross-listed with Social Studies (SS)\n---\nCourse Description:\nThis advanced course begins by exploring the early racialization of unfree labor in the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic world in the years leading up to the Columbian encounter, including precedents such as fifteenth-century Portuguese activity off the coast of Africa, the Spanish invasion of the Canary Islands, and the late Iberian Reconquest in general. It then moves into the emulation and modification of the Spanish model by other Atlantic imperial powers, notably Britain and France, and the general hardening of caste lines which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We also discuss the racial, religious and civilizational categories used by early modern missionaries, most notably the Jesuits, not only with respect to black and indigenous people in the New World but also with respect to civilizations encountered outside the domain of traditional imperialism in South, East, and Southeast Asia. We then discuss how these categories contributed to the formation of \u201cscientific\u201d racism and how the latter, in turn, intersected with a variety of nineteenth-century European and North American imperial and educational projects. We close by reading excerpts from postcolonial theorists who grapple explicitly with the concept of race and its future.  \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Understanding the difference between a historical paper and an historiographical paper; learning to read multiple scholarly opinions and heuristics and rapidly identify the differences between or among them; learning to mine information on the educational background and historiographical school, etc., of contemporary and past scholars (e.g. this person is a member of the Cambridge school of intellectual history and therefore focuses on ideas in context, while a social historian will think about the experiences of past people, especially past subaltern people, and so on); writing fluently in the key of historiography. \nThis contributes to the general goals of the major in terms of getting students to think historically, do their own research, read a wide variety of English-language sources critically, and so on. In general, historiographical writing requires less research than historical writing, but it is also more difficult because history undergraduates are trained to think of peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books as the \u201cword of God.\u201d Unlearning that and treating scholars as fallible historical people who, nonetheless, have done more serious research than any history undergraduate takes time and effort, and students will have to learn to read secondary sources much more closely and critically than they would otherwise do in order to construct an historiographical argument. They will also need to learn how to do creative research on the author\u2019s own biographies, for example finding CVs on university websites, reading acknowledgements pages, digging up juvenilia, and perhaps even interviewing the authors.  \n\n2. Understanding the degree to which European imperialism in its early modern/modern incarnation devolved on a) the introduction of religious-civilizational hierarchies unknown in the Middle Ages, which collapsed, to varying degrees, into racial-biological hierarchies b) the relaxation of prohibitions on unfree labor introduced during the Middle Ages. While imperialism, xenophobia, and exploitation were of course rife in the Middle Ages, as in any era, they did not take the racial and casteist forms which proliferated under Western rule c. 1500-1970, although other forms of casteism existed. Students will try to understand what made the ideological and material conditions for centuries of mass exploitation on an unprecedented scale possible. This course will also try to distinguish among the concepts of emperorhood, empire, and imperialism in a comparative context, focusing on the conditions which led to almost every Western European state declaring itself to be an empire during the early modern era, even states without a monarch.  \nGrappling with the problem of modernity and/or Western hegemony is a subject which inevitably comes up in history courses which deal with material after about 1450. While other courses may encourage students to think about these problematics in order, for example, to construct a heuristic for understanding longue-dur\u00e9e processes like capitalism or secularization, this course encourages students to confront the political, economic and ideological mechanisms of Western-led modernity head on.  \n---\nTentative Schedule\nWeeks 1, 2, 3: Early Iberian Imperialism  \nFrancisco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Muley, translated by Vincent Barletta.

Richard Philcox (1961; reis., New York: Grove Press, 2004) (excerpts)\nAssessments and Grading\nTwo historiographical papers, 20% of grade each, 1200-1500 words each. Students will learn to read and write historiographically while, where appropriate, bringing in historical evidence (e.g. primary sources) in order to reinforce historiographical claims. The main skill emphasized here is learning how to sort through scholarship, identify points where there is substantial scholarly disagreement, and try to identify the sources of those disagreements. This involves learning to skim large amounts of scholarship in order to identify historiographical disputes at a glance, which is an advanced skil.  \nFour introductions to in-class reading, presented and written with a partner, 300-500 words each, collectively 20% of grade. This assignment is intended to foster presentation skills and group work skills. In the case of readings which are older and/or notable among scholars (e.g. Black Skin, White Masks), students will be expected to work together to attain a basic literacy in the reception and legacy on the work presented on, as well as any controversies it may have generated. Again, this involves thinking critically about scholarship, learning about it as an artifact rather than accepting its contents as the \u201cword of God.\u201d  \nClass participation, 20% of grade. Students will by the time of their arrival in this class have some familiarity with seminar-style discussion, but the goal here is to perfect it, to use questions from the professor as a jumping-off point for classwide discussion and not a simple exam question with a right or wrong answer. Students will be graded in part on their ability to engage with others\u2019 participation.  \nFive interviews, collectively worth 10% of grade, 10 minutes each. Students will pair with a different partner from their partner in the introductions assignment for this assignment. Partners will create a 10-minute recorded interview in which they discuss what they thought were the high points of the readings and discussions of the past week of class. Interviews will be submitted the following Monday. These interviews are casual and are intended to improve: comfort with casual conversation in English; critical recollection and engagement with the material without instructor prompting; and level of engagement and attention in the class meetings leading up to the creation of an interview. Dead space is discouraged but recording many times to get a podcast-quality conversation is unnecessary.  ",

This is an introductory course and our focus will thus be broad. We will cover a wide range of texts from antiquity to the present day, from Ancient Greece to Jacobean England, Victorian England, French Indochina and the contemporary U.S. In doing so our aim will be to understand texts intertextually \u2013 to become alive to the ways that poems and prose draw on, and break from, longstanding literary traditions. We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it. We will read with the understanding that all of these ways of reading are mutually inclusive. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon course completion, students: \n\u2022 Will be able to explain the historical significance of several major literary traditions and their interrelations \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate the formal qualities of poetry, prose, and drama \n\u2022 Will be able to identify and critically evaluate key problems in texts\u2019 representations of individualism and civic responsibility \n\u2022 Will be able to engage in constructive peer review (as both reviewer and reviewee) in order to create effective and sound written and spoken analytical text\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nParticipation: 25% \nWeekly Response Postings: 25% \nMicro-assignments: 20% \nPresentation: 10% \nFinal Research Paper: 20%",

The tumultuous modern history of Vietnam (marked by three major wars, political division, unification, the destruction of one state, plus subsequent massive emigration of southern populations all over the world, as well asnormalization of international relations, and remarkable economic growth) has forced time and again, a deep and sometimes soul-wrenching reassessment of Vietnamese identity. Massive emigration over the 1970s and \u201880s following the Vietnam War, further complicated the question of identity, leading to large diaspora communities abroad with divergent values, aesthetics, and traditions. Throughout these upheavals, theproduction of short fiction, film, and tv have provided Vietnamese artists with a mirror of contemplation, a space for reckoning, and a canvas for the portrayal of alternative visions of Vietnamese life, society, and culture. Our class will begin with a range of short fiction produced at the end of the French period, in a time when Vietnamese intellectuals were struggling to imagine a new Vietnam free of colonial rule. We will then turn to depictions of the Vietnam war, and scrutinize both how foreign gazes represented Vietnam as well as how Vietnamese artists portrayed their own societies during this fraught time. Finally, we will turn to the postwar period, examining film, tv, and literature from both the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and contemporary diaspora communities, and ask how these artists imagine Vietnam and its future, in a time when the wars that tore apart the country are receding in memory.  \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nStudents will :\nObtain a working knowledge of Vietnam in relation to its colonial and modern history\nThink critically about narrative structure and their epistemological contributions across different media\nMake important intercultural and interdisciplinary connections beyond the region of Southeast Asia.\nProduce critical responses and essays in various formats (podcast, essay, video)\n---\nTentative Course Syllabus\n\nWeek 1: Introduction & Narrative\n-The Narrative Arc: \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d (https://thenarrativearc.org/plot)\n-Suggested: George Johnson, NY Times: \u201cA Widening world of Hand-picked Truths\u201d\n\nWeek 2: Identity, History, and the Western Gaze\n-Jamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cPreface\u201d\n-Barthes, \u201cAn Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative,\u201d pp. 237-260\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: Oliver Stone (1986), Platoon\n\nWeek 3: The chasm between old and new\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: Vi\u1ec7t Linh, M\u00ea Th\u1ea3o, Th\u1eddi vang b\u00f3ng\n-Fiction: V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng, \u201cS\u1ed1 \u0110\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cDumb Luck\u201d)\n\nWeek 4: Beyond existing boundaries\nJamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cBattle of the Novels\u201d\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Khoa, L\u00e0ng V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i ng\u00e0y \u1ea5y (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i Village\u201d)\n-Fiction: Nh\u1ea5t Linh: \u0110i T\u00e2y (\u201cGoing to France\u201d)\n\nWeek 5: Colonial vestiges\n-Saada, Empire\u2019s Children, \u201cIntroduction\u201d pp. 1-3\nPrimary materials:\n-Kim Lef\u00e8vre, White M\u00e9tisse (including introduction)\n\nWeek 6: Interculturality and ambivalence\nPrimary materials:\n-Kim Lef\u00e8vre, White M\u00e9tisse\n\nWeek 7: Hope and Disillusionment\n- Dror, \u201cLove, Hatred, and Heroism: Socializing children in North Vietnam duringWartime, 1965-\n75\u201d\nPrimary materials:\n-Fiction: L\u00ea Minh Khu\u00ea, \u201cNh\u1eefng ng\u00f4i sao xa x\u00f4i\u201d (\u201cDistant Stars\u201d), \u201cBi k\u1ecbch nh\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cSmall Tragedy\u201d)\n\nWeek 8: Watching the Autumns go by\n- Dror, \u201cRaising Vietnamese: War and youth in the South in early 1970s\u201d\nPrimary materials:\n- Nh\u00e3 Ca, Olga Dror: Mourning Headband for Hu\u1ebf (Selections)\n- Film: H\u00e0 Th\u00fac C\u1ea7n, \u0110\u00e2t Kh\u1ed5 (\u201cLand of Sorrows\u201d)\n- The music of Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n\n\nWeek 9: A Hard Morning\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh, Bao gi\u1edd cho \u0111\u1ebfn th\u00e1ng m\u01b0\u1eddi (\u201cWhen October Comes\u201d)\n- Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\n\nWeek 10: The Silence of Defeat\n- Kilbourne, Cinema, Memory, Modernity, Introduction\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: Ham Tran, V\u01b0\u1ee3t s\u00f3ng (\u201cJourney from the Fall\u201d)\n-Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\n\nWeek 11: Art and relics of history\n- Nguyen, Khai Tu, \u201cCai Luong and the Politics of North and South Vietnam\u201d\nPrimary materials:\n- Film: Leon L\u00ea, Song Lang\n\nWeek 12: Memory and Family history\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\n\nWeek 13: Reimaginations\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\n\nWeek 14: Diversification and Exploration\nPrimary materials:\n-Film: Charlie Nguy\u1ec5n, Ch\u00e0ng v\u1ee3 c\u1ee7a em (\u201cMy Mr. Wife\u201d)\n-Film: Swann Dubus, Trong hay ngo\u00e0i tay em (\u201cWith or Without Me\u201d)\n\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nAttendance and participation\nPresentation\nCreative Reflection\nMid-term paper\nFinal project",

By studying texts, films, and visual representations in the English language from the late eighteenth century to the present, we\u2019ll first learn how ships moved with increasing regularity on risky voyages between the world\u2019s oceans at the same time that novels came to dominate the literary world, and then turn our attention to the role of Pacific travel narratives in film, media, and prose narratives for expressing economic, military, and environmental anxieties in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As Michelle Burnham notes in Transoceanic America: Risk, Writing, and Revolution in the Global Pacific (2019), \u201cThese developments are related by their shared narrative dynamics, especially in the relationship between narrative suspense and numerical speculation, between words and numbers\u201d (23). Just as \u201cthe short-term risks and losses that attended these voyages were offset by their long-term profits, . . . the pleasure of accumulation concealed but also depended on the horrors of violence\u201d (ibid). Key authors include Captain James Cook, Herman Melville, Jack London, Amitav Ghosh, Nam Le, Lin Dinh, and films by H\u00e0m Tr\u1ea7n and Nguy\u1ec5n V\u00f5 Nghi\u00eam Minh, among others.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Successfully employ close reading and interpretive analysis skills when making evidence-based arguments about literary and filmic texts and other visual media. \n2. Apply the language and critical approaches of travel narratives, transnationalism, cultural studies, and literary studies when examining and discussing fictionalized, autobiographical, and factual portrayals of transpacific oceanic travel. \n3. Work comparatively, critically, and deconstructively across genres, mediums, and geographies to account for patterns in portrayals of self, other, and nation when examining narratives of Pacific voyages.\n4. Critically assess distinctions between different genres of cultural representations, including their limits, effects, and public reception; for example, between a short story and a graphic memoir or a documentary and a Hollywood film.\n5. Gain confidence in presenting original research and ideas in a public setting before a cohort of peers and faculty.\n---\nAssessments and Grading\nWeekly in-class short writing assignments (1-2 paragraphs each) (20%)\nShort close reading paper (15%)\nGroup presentation / discussion leader assignment (15%) \nFinal research paper (20%)\nClass conference / individual presentation (10%)\nClass participation (20%)",

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \n---\nTentative Syllabus\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \nSummary \nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race. Readings include Margaret Wilson\u2019s Indulgence, Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness and Power, Renato Rosaldo\u2019s Grief and the Headhunter\u2019s Rage, Marshall Sahlins\u2019 The Original Affluent Societies, Erik Harms\u2019s The Boss, Ernest Gellner\u2019s Nationalism, Benedict Anderson\u2019s Imagined Communities, Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019. This unit will culminate in short student presentations and discussions, and a cumulative final exam focusing on the application of concepts to contexts selected by the instructor.  \n---\nAssessments & Grading\nBook Report \u2013 Students will review and present a book related to a social science topic of their choice. They will then discuss the presentation in a group with their classmates.  \nMidterm Exam \u2013 Test familiarity with core concepts in social sciences and students\u2019 ability to connect them to contexts provided by the instructor \nFinal Exam \u2013 Test familiarity with core concepts in social sciences and students\u2019 ability to connect them to contexts provided by the instructor (summative)  ",

It is recommended students take this in their second year or later.  \n---\nCourse Description:\nDigital technology has fundamentally and dramatically changed the way people live, the way society develops, and, most importantly, it refined the fundamental nature of human civilization. We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \n---\nTentative Schedule\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

In Vietnam, several intriguing projects founded on DH applications have been carried out by Vietnamese museums, cultural heritage preservation offices, and higher education institutions. \n\"Digital Humanities in Vietnam Studies Contexts\u201d is specifically designed and offered in collaboration between Fulbright University and Vin University (hereafter \u201cVinUni\u201d). By nature, it is a connected course, in which students and instructors from the two institutions work on the same syllabus, mutually learning from each other, teaming up and teamworking together through various stages of a project of their team\u2019s choice. The course provides its students with basic knowledge of digital humanities, computational tools and interdisciplinary methods, and shows them how to apply them in research in social sciences and humanities in general and in Vietnam\u2019s contexts in particular.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nSpecifically, by the end of the course, students should be able to \nRaise questions in research in the field of the humanities and social sciences, and search for solutions with the help from computer science. \nRecognize potentialities for interdisciplinary DH (research) project \nIdentify characteristics of DH in terms of interdisciplinary of computer science and the humanities. \nCreate roadmaps of the DH circle of processing and interpretation (acquisition, processing, analysis, visualization, UX, interpretation). \nDesign and conduct a DH project step-by-step from data acquisition to new understandings on a simple humanities dataset, \nIdentify and describe copyrights of multiple datasets, as well as suggestions to use them appropriately, \nDigitize, process, and interpret written documents by using fundamental text understand methods \nDigitize, process, and interpret images, using fundamental code snippets of optical characterizing recognition \nDigitize, process, and interpret sounds and music, using fundamental code snippets of speech processing \nImplement, test and validate annotation dataset by using multiple crowdsourcing platforms, \nAnalyze and explain the basic steps of simple projects involving DH: acquisition, processing, analysis, visualization, UX, interpretation, \nSynthesize necessary steps to understand humanities datasets \nChoose appropriate pipeline constructs for a given DH task \nApply the techniques of decomposition to break a DH project into smaller stages, \nDescribe the concept of digital humanities and give examples of its applications, \nApply consistent theories and practical pipelines that contribute to the development of DH projects. \n---\nTentative Course Syllabus:\nWeek 1:1 \nWelcome and Introduction to the Course \nNiels Bruggers. \u201cDigital Humanities in the 21st Century: Digital Material as a Driving Force.\u201d 2016, Volume 10 Number 3.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam's nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nAt the end of this course, the student will be able to:\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\n---\nTentative Syllabus\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\nTilly, Charles.

The first 03 sessions will be Online.\nFaculty: Nguyen Nam - E: nam.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\nPre-requisite: CORE 102 Modern Vietnamese Cultures and Society. No freshmen allowed.\n*Cross-listed with History (HIS), Social Studies (SS), and Literature (LIT).\n---\nCourse Description:\nIn this two-semester course (identified as Honors Praxis lab at the University of Utah, hereafter \u201cUU\u201d), students will engage in deep, critical analysis of the American War in Viet Nam and critically examine the war\u2019s legacies across the sites of mind, body, culture, family, environment, politics, and memory. The American War in Vietnam was a pivotal event of the 20th century. As time has passed and its survivors aged into late adulthood, we have reached a critical time to reflect upon that war\u2019s legacy and to engage in conversations with those who experienced and survived it. Their experiences hold insights into war\u2019s true toll, and the means to survive, recover, and reconcile in the wake of war. Unique to this course will be a transnational, multiplex consideration of war\u2019s legacies across diverse populations who experienced that war on \u201cmany sides,\u201d including Vietnamese and American participants in the fighting, protestors against the fighting, and a wide range of noncombatants who, despite being on the \u201cmargins'' of the fighting, nonetheless experienced war\u2019s toll. We will critically discuss how experiences of war and post-war migrations between countries constitute diasporic connections between Vietnam and America today. Through readings, films, guest lectures, and our own conversations, we will develop an appreciation of military veterans\u2019 and noncombatants\u2019 experiences \u2013 their memories of war, experiences of trauma, and sources of resilience. We will also consider the intergenerational and international connections \u2013 of suffering, resilience, and healing \u2013 that have arisen out of the American War in Vietnam. \n\nThis will be offered consecutively in two semesters, Fall 2022 & Spring 2023. The first semester is the time to provide students with multi perspective viewpoints of the war and its legacy, helping them to build a theoretical foundation for further research. The second semester will be conducted in a seminar style, as Fulbright-Utah students have figured out a research topic for their year-end final project. It will provide students with significant hands-on experience as it will lead them through various research phases, and show them how to present the outcomes of each phase effectively to an academic audience. Joint seminars will be conducted with the participation of all students from the two institutions.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n-    Build a foundational knowledge of the geopolitical context, chronology, key figures, and events of the American War in Vietnam to situate that war\u2019s legacies. \n-    Develop awareness of the linked cultures, social relations, and histories spanning the U.S. and Viet Nam that emerged through war, and an understanding of one another as populations whose lives are shaped and interconnected by war; \n-   Comprehend how the American War in Vietnam, and other wars, have left enduring legacies upon critical sites of body, mind, culture, landscape, ecology, & society. This involves an appreciation of the many sides engaged in the war and the diaspora/transnational communities created by war.  \n-    Engage in critical discussion and analysis of data, artifacts, and methodologies for describing and explaining war legacies, the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches, the experiences to which they give voice, and silence. \n-    Through regular interaction and completion of shared assignments with team members at Fulbright University Vietnam and the University of Utah and, hone skills in cross-cultural awareness and communication, virtual collaboration, and team approaches to knowledge production. \n---\nTentative Course Schedule:\nWeek 1  \nReview syllabus \nOverview of course - themes, structure, assessment, Fulbright-Utah Student Teaming Up. \nThematic Focus: Diverse perspectives and diverse legacies of the American/Vietnam War \n\nReadings: \nGeorge Katsiaficas, ed.

        "description": "Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn \nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\nPre-requisite: VS205 Introduction to Vietnam Studies\n*Cross-listed with Literature (LIT)\n---\nCourse Description:\nAdaptation studies from literature to cinema have many apparent changes in the context of postmodernism. Based on the complexity of the theories such as intertextuality, translation studies, cultural studies, deconstruction, and reception theory, adaptation studies allow audiences to consider the film adaptations as independent films with respective creativities of filmmakers by their cinematic language. Because adaptation studies are interdisciplinary, this course will not only instruct students on how to read books and movies but also move beyond comparisons of sources and film adaptations. Adaptation studies can be considered as a methodology and a field. Therefore, the class will concentrate on communicating film adaptations with the texts they are adapting. During the term, students will practice analyzing several Asian film adaptations to illuminate adaptation studies and learn about the Asian cultural contexts surrounding the sources and their adaptations. The outstanding feature of the course is that students will understand what film adaptations show and do not show in comparison with their sources to break the notion of fidelity that limit the filmmakers\u2019 creativities in their adaptation process. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to meet some guest speakers who are Vietnamese filmmakers, such as Viet Linh, Phan Gia Nhat Linh, Vinh Son, Nguyen Vo Nghiem Minh to listen to their own experiences about adaptation. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to: \nBe able to analyze a film adaptation and write critically about how film adaptation reflects filmmakers\u2019 point of view and the context. \nInterpreting why the filmmaker changed and revised the source literary work. \nUnderstanding the equal relationship between literature and cinema \nPrepare and submit their essay in appropriate research. \n---\nTentative Course Schedule:\n\nWeek 1.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Throughout the fall 2020 term, you and your Fulbright classmates will be interacting and co-learning with a group of American students enrolled in a similar course at Dartmouth. Our two courses will function as a single \u201cconnected course,\u201d co-designed and co-taught by Dartmouth and Fulbright faculty, and using a common syllabus.  \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nStudents who successfully complete this course will:\nGain an introductory knowledge of the field of Vietnamese Studies and the major theoretical and practical issues in the field;\nConstruct a working definition of the meaning of development, informed by the critical perspectives developed by scholars in History, Environmental Studies, Literary and Film Studies, and other fields;\nInvestigate key questions in the study of the recent history of development in Vietnam (especially since the 1980s);\nInvestigate key questions in the study of environmental governance in contemporary Vietnam, especially as it relates to development;\nInvestigate how development has been represented, celebrated, and critiqued in contemporary Vietnamese literature and film;\nWork in a team composed of Dartmouth and Fulbright University students to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in contemporary Vietnam;\nCollaborate with their teammates to produce a short film that presents the main findings of their research project.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nAttendance: 5%\nParticipation: 10%\nOne-on-one interview assignment: 5%\nOnline Field Journal: 10%\nDartmouth-Fulbright Team Research Project: 60%\nSummative Reflection paper: 10%",

The primary goal is to give students conceptual and critical tools to understand and analyze how theories of international relations, Vietnamese foreign policy outcomes, and current political events fit together. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories to the problems we study, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in Vietnam as well as those facing decision-makers in other countries who deal with Vietnam. It is designed to develop students\u2019 capacity both to explain the foreign policy-making process in Vietnam, and to better understand the underlying patterns, logic, and implications of Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy in the world at large. \nThe course is divided into three main topics. First, we will discuss International Relations theory that grounds Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy by examining the core international relations paradigms: realism, liberalism and social constructivism. It presents their historical origins, the evolution of their various branches (classical realism, neo-realism, neo-liberal institutionalism, etc.), and studies the contemporary application of the most important theories in the field. The second part of the class will examine the peculiar institutions and processes that guide foreign policy formation and implementation. Questions will revolve around who set the foreign policy agenda and what are the important institutions attempting to implement this agenda. Finally, the last third of the course will review some of the major elements and the more salient foreign policy challenges facing Vietnam since 1975. We seek to understand the security-based rationale of policy as well as other factors \u2013 institutional, ideological cultural, perceptual, and so on \u2013 that influence Vietnamese foreign policy. We also analyze decision-making processes that shape Vietnamese foreign policy, and Vietnam\u2019s relations with various countries and regions. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nExplain the major theories of international relations (hereinafter IR). \nIdentify and describe the main similarities and differences among the major IR theories. \nIdentify the leading authors in the IR field, as well as the theories, seminal works and key concepts they are associated with. \nUnderstand the historical evolution of IR theory over time. \nApply theoretical frameworks to understanding practical international relations issues. \nAssess the behavior of actors in international politics in light of IR theories. \nEnhance the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary Vietnamese foreign policy (hereinafter VFP) and its historical development through the study of Vietnam\u2019s relations with major countries and regions of the world, and also exploring the key issues in these relations. \nProvide students with structured knowledge of VFP and enable them to independently explain VFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping VFP. \n---\nTentative Course Schedule:\n\nWeek 1: Course Introduction + What is Theory?  \n- Stephen Walt. 2005. \u201cThe Relationship between Theory and Policy in International Relations.\u201d Annual Review of Political Science (8): 23-48.  \n- Stephen Walt. 1998. \u201cOne World, Many Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy (Spring): 25-35.  \n- Jack Snyder. 2004. \u201cOne World, Rival Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy.
