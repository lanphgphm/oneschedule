Over the course of the semester, students will develop their written rhetorical, reading, and critical thinking skills. \nSummary\nIn order to change the world, it is worthwhile to look at \u201cchange,\u201d both as a historical fact and a concept that has consumed thought for generations. This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\n---\nLearning Objectives:\n\u00b7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\n\u00b7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work. Except in cases of health/family emergency that can be documented, tardiness or absences leading to missed graded in-class activities will result in students receiving a zero.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n ---\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading: \nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, student will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing some of these applications including representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. Accordingly, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.\n ---\nLearning Objectives\nThe main purpose of this course is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what the AI is. Students who become interested in AI may go on to the graduate school for further study. Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:\nAbility to apply knowledge of AI techniques and synthesize solutions to the discipline and ability to develop a range of typical applications using artificial intelligence methods.\nAbility to represent knowledge corresponding to practical problems, design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs by properly using classical search algorithms, including breadth-first, depth-first, A*, and heuristic search.\nAbility to produce intelligent applications of machine learning with statistical learning methods (Na\u00efve Bayes), supervised and unsupervised learning models: decision tree, neural networks, single-layer (perceptron) and multilayer networks\n---\nTextbook and References\nArtificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents by Poole and Mackworth.

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected.\nAn important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node.\nThe theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context.\n---\nLearning Objectives:\nTo analyze the complexity of the sustainability at large scale;\nTo consider the sustainability as a complex system made by various variables. The students will be instructed that every possible solution in the field of sustainability could emanate only from the combination of different majors, including social, architectural, technological and economical spheres;\nTo investigate real cases, study trips, workshops, focus on real projects and research at national and international levels;\nTo communicate with government institutions and private companies to investigate some key topics of sustainability at both building and urban planning levels;\nTo investigate the topic of Multi-Scale Approach at social, economical and technological levels applied in the local context;\nTo develop study cases, theory and technology for Appropriate Technology and Zero Emission Buildings;\n---\nAssessments:\nFinal Exam\nThe exam will be based on an individual paper for each student for the theoretical part. The students will prepare also a project developed according to their own interests and with the investigation on the local context. The project could be individual or collective. The topic of the papers and the project will be decided between students and professor after a preliminary discussion.",

The course considers the interplay between history, culture, politics and economics in the development of the complex and contested postcolonial Asian nation-states. It explores how identities based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, class and nation-state have shaped and defined the lives of individuals and types of societies in the region. Students will be equipped with a high level of cultural competence and global awareness. Central themes of the course highlight the interconnected yet culturally diverse nature of the world in which we live.\n---\nLearning Objectives \nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the great diversity of cultures and societies in Asia\nEvaluate the various meanings and representations of Asia and Asians\nIdentify how identities based on nationality, religion, ethnicity, class and gender (to name a few) have shaped and defined the lives of individuals and societies in the region\nApproach a topic with an open mind and a sense of tolerance\nDevelop research skills by collecting, reading and analyzing data\nExpress your research findings and ideas coherently and logically in writing\nExpress your ideas and appraise the ideas of others orally through presentation, active participation and discussion in\n---\nAssessments\nTBD",

In view of the urgent problems of our time, for example, climate change, it is entrepreneurs who inspire hope with technology-based developments and thus play a central role in politics and society. At the same time, entrepreneurs are ambivalent contemporaries who are seen as role models and are envied because of their success but are also often confronted with criticism and suspicion. All over the world, entrepreneurship is increasingly popular and is being promoted by governments, international organizations, and local NGOs as an income-generating strategy or as a solution to so-called \"disaster capitalism\".\nIn this course, we approach the anthropology of entrepreneurship from different theoretical perspectives. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, where on the one hand the relationship between entrepreneurship and social change (or the entrepreneur as a change agent) and the role of entrepreneurship in economic development were in focus, we follow how the perception and the view of anthropologists changed over time. Ethnographic examples range from Melanesian big men who became entrepreneurs, to ethnic, religious, ecological, and social entrepreneurship and to research on individual self-realization through entrepreneurship.\n---\nCourse Objectives \nLearning objectives event\nGetting to know theoretical debates and empirical case studies on entrepreneurship\nIndependent literature research\nStudents learn to critically question concepts relevant to the course\n---\nLearning Outcomes \nAfter completing this course, students will be able to: \nAcquire an understanding of the historical, political, and cultural context, current trends and future projections of digital technologies; \nExplain basic concepts and theories in new (digital) media; \nUnderstand the critical impact of media on a variety of contemporary issues such as privacy, surveillance, labor, and participation, as well as the construction of individual identity \u2013 gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality. \nBe able to critically examine and utilize digital tools in meaningful and innovative ways. \n---\nAssessments\nClass Participation\nPresentation\nSeminar Paper\nLife Story Interviews (transcribed)",

This course examines those vital connections and the social structures that create, shape and sustain them. In doing so, we will examine how those structures have been transformed and changed throughout the twentieth century up to the present moment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will draw on a variety of historical, sociological and anthropological works to help shed light on the ways \u201csocial capital,\u201d to use a modern concept, is built (or destroyed) and human connections preserved (or severed) for countless generations of Vietnamese, past and present.  \nAlthough the focus of the course is contemporary Vietnamese society and culture, any exploration of the present would be woefully incomplete without it being firmly anchored in the past, which for our course revolves around the traditional village and community that has been the life blood of Vietnam for the past thousands of years. We will therefore begin our course by looking at the traditional Vietnamese village structures and the social norms that govern the life choices and behavior of its residents. From there we embark on a historical journey that takes us through the colonial, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary periods until we reach the present time. \nThroughout the course students are encouraged to think about the structural forces that deeply influence, or in most cases, dictate one\u2019s thoughts and behaviors, and the role and place of an individual in the larger social structure in which he/she is embedded. Questions that students taking this course may want to think about include, but are not limited to, the following: What are the sources of Vietnamese culture and identity? How important are human connections and how can they be preserved? Is one\u2019s identity permanent and fixed, or is it contingent, fluid and negotiable? Would a Vietnamese person today still recognize and understand a Vietnamese born hundreds of years ago? Is it possible to essentialize some quality (or set of qualities) that captures all that is Vietnamese?  \n---\nLearning Objectives: \nThe course aims to give students a better understanding of Vietnamese society and culture and the trajectory of her evolution for the last one hundred years or so from a multidisciplinary perspective.  \nStudents will be introduced to basic concepts in the humanities, sociology and anthropology. This will provide them with a wider and sharper lens through which to view themselves, their society, and hopefully also the wider world into which Vietnam is trying integrate\nStudents will be able to interpret and analyze the causes and consequences of many common social, cultural phenomenon in modern-day Vietnam. On that basis, it is hoped that they will accordingly formulate an appropriate philosophical outlook and chart an effective and wise career path for personal development and social betterment after graduation.\n---\nCourse Schedule\nSESSION 1 Introducing Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework to Understand the Trajectory of Vietnamese Society\u2019s Evolution \nReading \nT\u00f6nnies, Ferdinand. \u201cCommunity and Society [Gemeinschaft Und Gesellschaft]\u201d in Jan Lin & Christopher Mele, eds.
